- Forget about the question of “taste” in jmat^s which concern no one but the indi,viihtal. Soine people on campus may not consider it "good taste” fo sipokej and to wear hluejeans on the,^ way to class, but most people should look at the problem in the light that so long ,ns the girls don’t smoke in ittost of their classes, and so long as they a^deai^f blqe jeans in all classes, nothing “dangerous”, pr still worse—^“scandalous”—^is liable to has^h. Conformity is a great word* , . , , But it is more than that. Much more. And it has many dangerous weapons on its side— and many unfair weapons. Bqt without many types of'non-conformity there would be no progress. .. . , From the last statement, we do not infer that , smoking cigarettes and wearing blue Jaans on the way to class is leading to progress. .But we do say that it definitely is not detracting from progress. . We do say that there is still a doubt in our innocent minds as to who shall judge any-j^riung-tobepf .Jdore..often “poor taste” of the blup >jpan and cigarette, variety is more than neutraliz-;^ ed:hy. the suffering s^nnster viewpoints of leaders of puldic m^ ality. , w' .Girls on the campus„ no m.atter v wear to class, where, they smoke^ or. how they rankle, amateur liadies’ Aids, .are.
