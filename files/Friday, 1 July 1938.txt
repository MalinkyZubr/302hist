NEWS
since Sunday WASHINGTON Red Ink . . .
Total national debt is now $37,126,000,000, and shows possibilities of reaching the $40,000,000,000 mark during the coming year. The average is $287 per person living in the United States.
Food And Flood . . . . . . control bills received Presidential approval this week. Monday, Secretary of Agriculture Henry Wallace announced President Roosevelt had signed the Copeland Act, putting into effect three chief provisions: 1. Prohibits the distribution of drugs injurious to health. 2. Requires testing of new drugs before being placed on sale. 3. Prohibits distribution of cosmetics which may be injurious to health. One of the 54 bills signed Wednesday was the $386,500,000 omnibus Flood Control Bill, and its signing was accompanied by the President’s appeal that Congress provide a better coordinated water-ways-soil program as soon as possible.
This program, said the President, “involves a wider survey and the examination of more national problems than any one bureau of department is qualified for.” It includes flood control, soil erosion, reclamation, reforestation, and navigation.
Best Topic . . . . . . this week for Republican and other anti-New Deal editorial Writers is the address which Chief Deputy WPA Administrator. Aubrey Williams, of Washington, D. C., made Monday to organized relief workers, 4n, which he urged them to “keep their friends in power.” Editorials on page one and succeeding pages of anti-Administra-tion newspapers decried Williams’ statements. Political speeches still echo his remarks.
NATIONAL Two Kill-Crazy Outlaw . . .
, , , brothers shot Indiana State Trooper Ray Dixon, kidnapped three men and a four year old boy, then began a brief reign of terror that led authorities over wide territories in Indiana Sunday night and M-onday. .Deputy .sheriffs and state police trapped the outlaw Easton brothers in a corn field near Deselm, Illinois, shot Clarence, wounded Orelle, after a 20 minute gun battle. Meanwhile Trooper Dixon died after failing to respond to blood transfusion. Dixon, strangely enough, dreamt of death from the bullets of a criminal just a year ago. He amused his friends with the story of his dream where James Dalhover, Brady gang gunman, covered him with a submachine gun while his own gun stuck in its holster. Dixon, however, woke up before his dream threatener shot.

Purdue Exponent
Ballot Intended To Determine Campus Opinion
. . . closed U. S. Treasury books again yesterday for the eighth consecutive fiscal year. National debt at the end of this governmental accounting period amounted only to $700,000,000 more than that of a year ago, although the nation spent $1,360,000,000 above its income. Idle gold paid the difference.

Kimball To Lecture At Convo Tuesday
Old Engineering Building Will Be Chem Lab Annex
Casts To Present First 3 Outdoor Plays Wednesday
Dr. Dexter Kimball, dean emeritus of engineering at Cornell University, will speak at the third lecture convocation Tuesday morning at 9 o’clock in Eliza Fowler Hall. After serving as a machinist apprentice for a time. Dean Kimball enrolled at Cornell. Immediately after graduation he worked as a designing engineer, then returned to Cornell as an instructor.
Cornell Dean
Goes Into Industry Again Kimball went into industry, as superintendent of an engineering company. And again he came back to Cornell University, this time as a professor of machine design. His interests now turned to the broader social phases of engineering and management. In this field he won the name “dean of management engineering educators.” Dean Kimball has written several books in both machine design and management. His recent volume “Principles of Industrial Organization’” is widely used as a handbook in industry and as a text in colleges and universities.
Engineering Administration Building, former home of the school of electrical engineering, is now under the supervision of the chemistry department and hereafter will be known as the Chemical Laboratory Annex. President E. C. Elliott made this announcement yesterday to University administrative officers and staff members concerned.
The building, a campus landmark, was constructed in 1889. Several years ago, the tower built on one comer of the structure was removed—at the time the electrical engineering school was moved to its present home on Northwestern Avenue.
Production work on Summer Session dramatics is progrressing steadily, and the summer’s first plays will be ready for presentation in Ross-Ade Stadium next Wednesday night, H. Kenn Carmichael, University director of dramatics, announced yesterday. Summer Playshtop members are working on three dramas to be given in the Stadium on that night, Carmichael said. George Ade’s “The Mayor and the Manicure,” “The Dear Departed,” and “The First Dress Suit,” make up the program for the affair.
Big question on the University campiis today sums itself into six words: Shall Purdue have a Summer Prom? Suggested , in Exponent’s “Bold and Black” column ten days ago, the idea caught the interest of a number of students and started them talking. Prof. O. F. Hall’s Summer Session social and recreational committee took up the subject.
Four Take Roles
Young Advances 10 Commandments For Farm Finance
Ade’s play requires four character roles which are being filled by Robert Schlendorf, as the Honorable Otis Milford; Alfred Exton, as WiUie Milford, his son; Thais Crepps, as Ruth Foster, engaged to 'Willie; and Genevieve LeClair, as the manicurist.
Dr. Dexter Kimball
Roys To Present History of Tubes
Received. Lamme Award He is a past president of the American Engineering Council and also of the Society for Promotion of Engineering Education. He recently received the Lamme reward for distinguished engineering service in education.
Professor C. S. Roys, of the school of electrical engineering, will give the third science “chat” next Tuesday at 7:30 p. m. in the faculty lounge of the Union Building. Professor Roys will present “The History and Development of Electron Tubes” in his demonstration lecture. Last night Professor Roys said, “Vacuum tubes have made transcontinental telegx^hy possible. Without tubes we would have no radio, transmitting or receiving, and the present development of television would have been impossible.” During the evening Professor Roys will trace the development of the vacuum tube from the discovery of the Edison Effect through to the latest types of tubes. As he discusses each kind of tube he will indicate the particular application for which it is suited.
Dr. Kimball is no newcomer to the University campus. Only last summer he lectured at the Purdue Institute on American Policy and Technology.
Swaney Writes Book On Soilless Growth
Dr. Miller W. Swaney, who received his doctor’s deg^ree in chemistry from the University in 1935, is co-author of a book titled “Soilless Growth of Plants” which is just off the press. Printed by the Reinhold Publishing Company, of New York, the book is a practical guide containing instructions and formulas for growing plants without soil in the parlor or back yard, as well as in large greenhouses. This practical handbook, written in popular style, brings to the general reader the possibilities and advantages of growing plants in chemical solutions.
“Ten Commandments” of sound farm finance were advanced today by Dr. E. G. Young, of Hie University Farm Management Department, in an address Jbefore approximately Y5 rui^al ministers attending the annual Rural Leadership School, which comes to a close today, concluding a ten day program. Dr. Yoimg spoke on “Financing Farm Operations,” and his “commandments” were gathered from a personal study of the experiences of farmers covering many years. The “ten commandments” of sound rural credit given the ministers were: 1. “Keep farm capital in such a form that you can farm, intelligently rather than as circumstances require. 'This may mean curtailing the volume of farm operations somewhat in order to increase security and flexibility. Make Operating Budget 2. “Make a farm operating budget each year, and use the budget loan when money is borrowed. 3. “Liquidate farm loans out of earnings during the life .of the loan. 4. “Maintain a safe margin of earnings calculated on a conservative basis to retire loans. There is a tendency for farmers always to
Invitation to attend the evening’s program has been extended to author Ade, but no reply has yet come in.
Tony Ippoiito leads the cast of “The Dear Departed,” with Phyllis Mae Umfreys, Sara Alice McIntosh, Paul Humphrey, Jayne Myer, and Joe Martin adding to the ente3rtainment in the play, Roles for “The First Dress Suit,” third production on the program, include Ira French, Mary Elizabeth Yeager, Mary Blocker, and Harold Martin.
States Will Give Physics Lecture
{Continued on .page 3)
,Dr. M. N. States, director of research, and development for the Central Scientific Co., Chicago, Illinois, will present “The Cultural Course in Physics” next Wednesday at 4 p. m. in the lecture room of the Physics Building. Last night Professor K. LarkHorovitz, head of the University physics department, said, “Dr. States is much concerned with the development of interest in physics and will stress in his lecture at Purdue the necessity of connecting physics with other sciences, and the social aspects of physics in everyday life.
A regular summer mixer is scheduled for Friday night, July 29, and one suggestion advanced by the social committee is that a good orchestra be signed for this affair and that it be turned into a Prom. To get a poll of student opinion on the Summer Prom question, copies of the ballot appearing in today’s Exponent will be distributed to persons attending tonight’s mixer. Ballots will also be available at the west Union desk this afternoon in order to provide all University students a chance to express opiiiions on such a dance. Young To Play At M^er Plasring for tonight’s regularly scheduled mixer is Sterling Young and his up-and-coming orchestra, traveling to Purdue from Stevens Hotel, Chicago. The group recently completed an engagement at Hotel Gibson, in Cincinnati. Hours for tonight’s dance are the usual 9 to 12, and the price is the regular $1. Students questioned at random last night expressed the following opinions of a Summer Prom at Purdue: “It’d Be Fun” From deep in a kinesiology study at Miss Acheson’s practice house, Elizabeth Maier, HE ’39, reported, “It’d sure be fun.” “I’ll be there,” Jack Smalley, local mechanical engineering junior, promised. Ed Sawyer, one of the mass of chemical engineers around this summer, asserted, “I think it would be wonderful, if I had any money.” “If you have it in three weeks, before I get my thesis done. I’ll come,” agreed D. M. Byers, chemistry instructor. Ted Cabonargi, ME ’39, is worried. “I’m afraid to think of it,” he admitted. “100% In Favor” “We’re one hundred per cent in favor of it,” was the report from Home Management House No. 2. No one at No. 1 house could be pulled away from their books qr the kitchen. Results of today’s balloting will be published in the next issue of this paper, Thursday, July 7.

Editor’s Note: Limin Kung is a-20-5year-old Ehinese boy who arrived in the United States about 10 weeks ago to continue his college education at Purdue. He was pursuing second-year studies at Nankai University when that institution was destroyed
by Japanese troops.
Kung came to Purdue about the middle of June to register for summer school, in electrical engineering. He .expects to be here at'least three years.
Publication Dates
Exponent will publish Summer Session issues on the following dates: July 7, 14, 21, and 28; and August 4 and 11. n
By L. Kung / Sin^China stepped into the new life—at the year 1936 a new life movement is given by our Generalissimo Chiang Kaishek—every kind of work is changing. Especially is the life of students different since then. I will write something about this. There are two kinds of university. One is national university, the other is private. Their systems are about the same but the first belongs to the government; so the work is harder there than in the second one, and the entrance test is more difficult than for the second.
Nankai Wa^ Destroyed As I knew, there are two
private universities. One is^N^kai Univermty^, ^sit^at6d''lhr"TienTsin, which was d^^oyed by Japan. 'The other is Kianiin University, in Niuiking; it might be also destroyed. Now we turn to the students’ life. First is expenses. If you study in national university, tuitiop is only ten or fifteen dollars a semester, but if you study in a private university, it will cost you one hundred
dollars for one semester.
About the living accommodation, every university has dormitory. The difference as that living outside or living in the private university’s dormitory is more comfortable and • more expensive than living in the national university’s dormitory. This is because the national university does not charge residence fee. Then about where and how the
/"''''''studeffirs-.est-Jtheir meal. Most of id the universities do not serve meal,
but there are many ^restaurants around or inside the university. So there are three ways to eat. The cheapest way is to find four or five friends and eat together at the restaurant every day; it only cost ten dollars a month for each person. The Chinese food is different from American so we can
eat so many together.
The second is to buy the ticket from the restaurant worth the value of one dollar and twenty cents’ for only one dollar. The last is the expensive way. This one is to eat at any place you like and any time you wish, but only a few eat in this way. Second is about activities. In general we have choir, Chinese opera, study of world society, and so forth. Those small groups always hold meetings, either to ex-
change members’ opinion or invite some person to give a speech about once or t-wice a week, but most of the time is spent on the charity con-
cert.
Some Publish Papers Some of the universities print a paper once or t'wice a week. It contains short stories, news, notices and sports calendai*. Some of them have radio broadcasting station oi* amateur club. All of this belongs to the students themselves.
Now third is about sports, I think they are much the same as hei’e. The only difference is, we use indoor baseball instead of outdoor baseball, and soccer instead of football.
We do not have a ballroom at the university and do not dance very often. We also do not have the fra-tex-nity or soxerity house.r

EDITORIAL
THE PURDUE SUMMER EXPONENT
HUMOll
Friday, July 1, 1938
A Summer Prom . . .
. . . sounded like a pretty wild idea to us when we first mentioned it in Bold and Black ten days ago. Summer Session social committee members and the Union, however, took the idea, which then was only mentioned in fun, in a more serious vein and decided it had possibilities. After thinking it over we’ve decided it’s not such a bad idea after all, and we’re convinced it can be done if the students want it. So we’re printing a questionnaire ballot in today’s Exponent to find out just what sort of a Prom — if any — would appeal to the summer school student body. Copies of this ballot will be available at the Union desk today and at the mixer tonight. The ballots may be turned in at the desk or placed in the Exponent box. We agree now with the social committee and with the Union that such a dance should be a great success ... if enough students indicate favorable opinion on the ballots the Summer Prom can become a reality.
Some New Ideas . . .
. . . about laboratory work are being tried out on metallurgy students this summer. Instead of running their experiments according to some cut and dried procedure plan outlined by the instructors, these fellows are merely told what to test for . . . then they must work out their own plan of attack, and may do the testing in th-eir own way. That system probably means more work for the students, but it seems to us that those students will also learn a whole lot more. Merely running through the tests doesn’t teach the average fellow very much, but the planning and knowledge necessary to figure out a suitable experiment procedure should be of much greater value. Then to compensate for the added work, these metallurgy students get another ad-

vantage we think is a fine idea. The whole group working each experiment is allowed to turn in a common report — except for the conclusions, which each member of the group must compile and turn in independently. Thus the tedious and valueless labor of copying data and listing apparatus is cut down to a minimum.

Plan Complete Operation 6. “Plan the operation through to completion before the loan is negotiated and the operation is started. - 7. “Do not plan to use your full line of credit in the beginning of the operation. Unfavorable developments may require further borrowing during the life of the operation. 8. “Consolidate your production credit borrowing into one line. Avoid accumulating debts or other liabilities outside the credit included in your line. 9. “Be honest with yourself and keep yourself in a full and accurate statement of your total debts, open accounts, and contingent liabilities. 10. “Do not go security for other people unless you can afford it, or unless you are in turn amply se--CTired.”
Editor’s Note:^“Vines Ellsworth,” the hero of this true episode, Is a student here this summer. He is more than ordinarily interested in sports, and keeps up on latest news in that field. We have withheld his real name for obvious reasons. By Rolfe Jenkins You just can't convince Vines Ellsworth. First Dr. Eastwood tried (and failed), then he referred the problem to one of the country*s leading recreational directors, C. D. Brown, who is executive vice president of the Athletic Institute, Inc., of Chicago. But even Mr. Brown couldn't shake our hero’s firm convictions. No sir, you just can’t prove it to Vines. Vines, you see, contended that mass instruction in sports wasn’t worth a dam. In fact Vines went so far as to tell Athletic Director Eastwood so, to his face. That started the trouble. Just to prove to Vines that mass instruction IS worth a dam, Eastwood took him to see Brown, who is a leading exponent of this form of recreational direction. Vines Is The Pig Brown agreed to demonstrate that he could get results. But alas! He picked our hero. Vines, as one of his guinea pigs. From the time of that unlucky decision his demonstration was destined to be a sad flop. Ten times he tried to make Vines Ellsworth miss a tennis ball with a stringless racquet, and ten times V. E. smartly returned the ball to his instructor’s feet from his racquet’s rim. This was unheard of, but Brown did not give up. Next he attempted to make Vines place his shots—^but no, still our hero could not be taught. A red ball was introduced, but not to Vines Ellsworth. Time passed,'clouds gathered, and the class time expired. Vines wish-

ed he could too, but the instructor demanded that he remain till the threatening rain came, hoping, no doubt, to find out what would happen when a rainstorm hit someone who was already all wet. The rains came, Instructor Brown gave up and left for Chicago, but our hero was heard to mutter” as he strutted olf the courts, “I knew it all the time, mass instruction is the bunk!”
Summer Session
Camp Team 7-2
Starting out with a rush similar to that of last year’s series opener, the Summer Session baseball team defeated Ross Camp 7-2 on intramural field Thursday afternoon. The victors used three hurlers, each of whom allowed the visitors one lone hit while their teammates were tapping out six safeties. Play in the field was very ragged, errors accounting for most of the runs. The campers started out with a one-run lead in the first inning off of Massoth, although it was unearned, but the Summer Session nine came back in the fourth with five runs on three walks and two hits with a couple of errors mixed in to take a lead which was never challenged. Chamberlin and Wadley were the other two Summer Session pitchers who went three innings' apiece. The two teams plan to meet in the second game of the five-game series at Ross Camp on the day of the picnic, July 8.
Harry Krause, Purdue backstop for the last thi^ years, has signed with the New iTork Giants. Krause probably won’\^ see action in a game but will be used mainly as a warm up catcher. Harry likes to play baseball and under the guiding eyes of Gus Mancusb and Harry Danning may develop into a really fine catcher. —FC— Krause is the third Boilermaker catcher in recent years to get a start in organized baseball—Hugh “Dopey” Wise and Dutch Fehring were the other two. Wise saw considerable action in the American Association and had a short stay in the National League before accepting his present post as playing manager of the Owensboro, Ky., nine of the Kitty League. Fehring, Purdue baseball coach, was with the Chicago White Sox a part of one season before giving up active playing for coaching. «. ^FC— The long waited race between War Admiral and , Seabiscuit will never take place. The ’Biscuit has scratched his last race. Prior to Tuesday’s running of the $50,000 Massachusetts Handicap Seabiscuit injured a tendon in his foot. The two veterinarians who examined the great thoroughbred said he would never run again. War Admiral, the favorite, finished fourth, placing out of the money for the first time. Menow was the winner. —FC— Less than three hours later Dauber was scratched in'the $50,000 American 3-year-old championship stakes at Hollywood Park, Calif. Dauber suffered an injury very similar to Seabiscuit’s. Lawrin, Kentucky Derby winner, won going away. A sudden silence came over the 60,000 gathered at the track wTien the announcement came over the public address system that Dauber wouldn’t run. Trainer Ben Olson broke into tears when he learned the news.

Participants Test Skill At Activities On Varsity Field In spite of threatening weather which finally chased an enthusiastic group of participants from the varsity field north of the Fieldhouse 20 minutes before the scheduled finish, 75 people attended the first night of “Games on the Green” yesterday evening. The assortment of games was accepted with a great deal of pleasure by those who tested their varied talents at badminton, ring tennis, or one of the other evening group activities. “It was good considering the threatening weather,” Chief Clevett said as he was picking up the croquet racquets after a sudden strengthening of the shower, which had been coming down lightly for some time, made the gamesters scurry for cover at about 7:40 o’clock.
Brave Ones Rewarded Those who braved the cloudy sky felt well rewarded. One lad said, “Sure, it’s a lot of fun. Are they going to have one of these nights every week?” He had just finished a lively game of softball on the diamond north of the other courts. One of the two teams which were formed by two picked players choosing sides breezed through to a 16-4 victory. At the east side of the field were several students playing badminton on two courts set up there. Ring tennis was next to the badminton court, with croquet on the west side of the ring tennis. The tether ball afforded one of the popular games, as some of the people stood to one side and waited their turn to slam the ball around the post. Next to this game were the archery targets.

K P Duty Over Week-End Awaits Knox ‘Bad Boys’
By Milton Roeves Exponent Staff Correspondent Fort Knox, Ky., June 30— First thing I want to accomplish before going into more details of the life of an embryo soldier is to clarify the position of Colonel “McNeal.” It seems that in one of my previous letters I stated that head man at ROTC camp was Colonel McNeal, of Ohio State University. Uirfortunately, this is an erroneous statement for two reasons: Not only did I misspell the
gentleman’s name, but I also associated Kim with the vu’ong school.
His real name is Colonel McNeill, and he hails from Ohio University, instead of Ohio State.
that must be performed, holiday or no holiday. So the chief bad boys—that is, the fellows vdth the most demerits—are detailed on duties that require their presence at camp over the week-end.
Bad Boys Must Stay I hope this mistake won’t ire the colonel to the point of giving me K. P. duty on the Fourth of July, because I’ve already laid plans for going home this week-end. There are certain duties, however.
It’s going to be a tough break for some of the fellow?, but I guess it’s just another lesson on “crime doesn’t pay.”
Schreiner are pressing them hard for first place, because they also have received a couple of “skins.” Not to be outdone. Season, Bruning, and Carter are keeping Culver in the running by having two demerits each.
charge of B’try A, informs me Wadleigh got one of his demerits for dirty boots and the other for getting into camp from Louisville after taps had been sounded Saturday night.
Leading the demerit race in B’try B are Joe Donovan and Bob Sasser, with two apiece. Sam Brown and Tramer
Wadleigh Takes Lead B’try A does not have such a closely contested race., Eric Wadleigh holds an undisputed first place, because he is the only boy in the battery having more than one demerit. Sergeant Capps, 1st sg’t in
I saw Eric working Tor an hour and a half Monday afternoon mowing the grass off the B’try street. Evidently he was trying to get his two demerits worked off before the Fourth,
We went on the pistol range Monday, and I got my first
taste of actually firing a .45 caliber revolver. There isn’t as much kick to the gun as you would expect, but it certainly makes plenty of noise. Ears Still Whistle There’s still a distinct whistling sound in my ears, ,and whenever anyone speaks to me it sounds as if he was talking with his mouth full of^food. Although we each shot forty rounds Monday, they were merely practice rouiids for the record firing that took place Tuesday.
Two days of pistol firing is all we get during the six weeks’ period. I wish we could have more time on the pistol range, because firing those .45’s is sure lots of fun. We’ll probably forget all about pistol during the next week and a half, though, because we start firing artillery pretty soon.
First sergeant for the week, Steve Novak, is calling for lights out ... so I’ll be leaving you till next issue.

1500 Enjoy Old Time Tunes At First Sing
Old time songs and old time humor entertained 1500 townspeople, faculty men, and students Wednesday night at the first Summer Session sing, held at the north end of Ross-Ade Stadium. Song Leader George Campbell completely won his audience with the first few words of his introductory remarks. Before the evening was over he had the crowd cheerfully running through exercises resembling last year’s Big Apple. ■
Wanted: Boys to wait tables at Union Building. See Miss Nugent at Union.
Singing a few songs over three or four times, rather than trying many pieces, the crowd soon learned the words and tempo, and joined whole-heartedly in the music-mak-ing. Homespun Humor Campbell, who is a nationally known song leader, livened up the program with his homespun humor—he claimed it was Scottish, Taking advantage of situations in the crowd, the program, and the small amount of heckling that was
going on, Campbell averaged about three puns and two legitimate jokes between every number. After singing “The Radiant Morn,” by Woodworth, the Oxford Choir, of Oxford, Indiana, ran the whole length of the Blue Danube as they gave a 20 minute rendition of Strauss’ immortal waltz dedicated to that river. The choir was under the direction of Mrs. Vera Vickers, and was accompanied by two violins, a flute, and a piano.
