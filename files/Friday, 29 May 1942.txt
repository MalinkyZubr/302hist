Sinfonietta, Hertha GIaz To Present Concert Sunday Contralto Will Sing With Instrumental Group At Summer Convo In Music Hall Featuring Hertha Glaz, operatic contralto, the St. Louis Sinfonietta will present the third in the series of summer convocations Sunday afternoon at 3 in the Music Hall. The program for the concert will include the overture to “The Marriage of Figari,” by Mozart; London Symphony Number 2; Introduction and Allegro, by Ravel; “Traume,” by Wagner; “Die Trommel Geruehret,” Beethoven; Moussorgsky’s “Hopak”; and Emperor Waltz by Strauss. Hertha Glaz will perform immediately before the intermission, singing “My Heart Ever Faithful,” by Bach and
the aris “Ombra mai fu” written by Handel. Early Debut Miss Glaz has sung as many as three hundred performances in a single season. This singing marathon took place when slie was only eighteen years old, and had just made her debut at the State Opeja in Breslau, Austria, although pi ofe.ssionally she was a novice, she had at her command thirty-five different roles. The night after Miss Glaz’ debut she was asked to fill in for a singer who was ill. The next day she again met an emergency. The directors of the opera soon planned for the young singer to be on hand for every performance and often she sang' twice a day. Sang Modern Roles Not only did she participate in the traditional operas—such as'the Wagnerian “Ring,” “Aida,” and the like—but akso in the modern operas of Krenek and Hindemith. The St. Louis Sinfonietta is confposed of seventeen men all of whom play in the St, Louis Symphony Orchestr'a, and are under the direction of Paul Schreiber. The touts of the “little symphony” follow the long winter season programs of the major orchestra, and will include eight different states this yeai. Complete Orchestration The Sinfonietta has completed orchestration, the stiing .section being more plentifully supplied than other parts. There are violins, a viola, a cello and a bass in the string division; and a flute, clarinet, oboe, and bassoon in the woodwind section. Other instruments include ti umpet, French hoin, trombone, and percus-
sion.

200 Sailors Arrive For Training Here Seamen Will Begin Studies Monday At 8 “The fleet’s in” was the word passed around the campus last night, following the ai rival of the first group of 200 sailors to begin 16 weeks training at the University as naval electiicians. The University was officially commissioned earlier in the week as a naval training station, with a quota of 800 men. Half of the seamen had reported by 10 o’clock yesterday morning, having been assigned here from the Great Lakes Naval Training Station. These men reported individually from their homes in all parts of the country, following a furlough. The remainder ariived by train yesterday afternoon from another coastal training center. Billeted In Cary Hall The sailors marched to the campus where they were inspected and assigned to their respective billets in Cary Hall West. The remainder of the day was spent in getting their gear and rooms in order. They ate their fiist meal “aboard ship” at 5:16, and lights were out at 9:15. The men were to be assigned to sections today, after which they will make a tour of the campus to become familiar with the buildings in which they will study. During their training period they will be housed and fed in Cary Hall, observing the same naval regulations that they would at sea. Classes Begin Monday Classes in electrical theory, mathematics, electrical laboratory, wiring practice, and tool laboratory will start at 8 o’clock Monday morning. The men will attend classes Monday through Thursday with examinations on Friday. Their studies will prepare them for the general duties of a naval electrician’s mate. Instruction for the sailors is being handled by the University war training office, headed by Prof. C. W. Beese, with Don A. Scott acting as supervisor of naval training. Cosmopolitan Club . . . will meet tonight at 7:30 in the West Faculty Lounge of the Union. Marriages in the U. S. and abroad will be discussed. A student from each of the vaiious foreign countries will speak on marriages in his native countiy. Eveiyone is invited to attend.
man, Ken Bradfield, Frank King and Tom Hobbs of the Ag school; Larry Myers of the Chemical Engineering school; Bob Olson of the Civil school; 41 Pastrick of the EE school; and Don Elfvin of the Mechanical school. Faculty Is Powerful Latest reports from the pedagogues via Head Coach “Red” Mackey, tell of a powerful and threatening force of bat-slingers being ammassed to represent the faculty in the senior-faculty classic. The exact selections and starting line-up of the faculty is shrouded in as much mystery as a military secret. No hint of the potential force of the “lettered nine” will be dropped until the initial publication of the squad members early next week. Ball To lintroduce Teams Dick Ball, editor of the Debris, will act as master of ceremonies at the ball park and willjntroduqe the members of both teams before the game. Gold Peppers dressed in the senior-coed yellow sweaters will keep the whisk brooms busy and the water buckets moving during the game. The senior parade will form in front of University Hall on the'bval at 1:16 p.m. and from there will march to the varsity ball field Via the street next to the chemistry annex. Professor Frank C. Hocketna, assistant to the president, will toss out the first ball and start the game on its way at 2 p.m. Union Supplies Banners The Student Union will supply the senior paraders with banners and placards indicating each man’s class, i.e., “seniors,” “University juniors,” and “graduating sophomores.” Anyone else who is interested in carrying a placard bearing a slogan fitting the occasion is encouraged to do so. Weekly Mixer Featurct Given's Music Tonight Tonight’s mixer sponsored by the Student Union will be held in the north ballroom of the Union Building from 8:30 to 11:30 and will feature the music of Irv Given and his orchestra. No Paper Sunday While Saturday is not a holiday as far as the University schedule is concerned, it is a legal holiday nonetheless and therefore a holiday for the printing indus’try. Hence, there will be no Exponent Sunday morning. Those on the Exponent staff who are scheduled to work Saturday night may > consider themselves men of leisure for the day.
Synthetic, Reclaimed Rubber Fails To Solve Present Crucial Problem
Kditoi’n Nolo: Tins is tlip Bocimd of a Eeius of nrticlos picpaiiU liy tlif OIIill' for Emeiaency MaiiuKcmioit dcaliiir with the rubhei shortaRe. When the Japane.so i cached Southward through the Pacific, over-ran Malaya and the Netherlands Ea.st Indies, and Japanese warships placed thcm^selves athwart communications lines' between the Pur East and Ameiica, they did more than cut oil' the source of 98 per cent of the riihbei consumed every year by the U. S. A., for they destioyed the S'Oiirce of virtually all rubber consumed by what we call “The United Nations.” Some of these Nations which, like the U. S. A., produced hardly any rubbei, began to lay by stores of rubber when the outlook in the Par East grew menacing. Some of them notably the Russians, were experimenting with synthetic rubber. But
wheieas the Geimans, spin red on by absolute necessity, developed a huge synthetic iiibbei indiisliy, tlie Russians bad done no moie to develop a sizable synthetic rubber iiidustiy befoie this war tliaii ve bad U. S. Must Supply Most Ol Rubber By fur the gieatei amount oliitlie lubber needed by the United Nations dining 1942 must be supplied by the United States. The 1942 leqiinemeiits of the United Nations groiqi aie huge. The United Kingdom lequires i ubliei to be fabiieated into liairage balloons, into treails of Biitisli tanks, to supply tires for the fighting aireiaft, and Canada and the other Dominions will need some, Russia’s niiiiinium lequirenienis add to the sLapgeinig total minimum needs elsewhere throughout the , 1
woi Id. It is against this huge demand that we must place the total world supply, actual and potential, a sii^ ))ly winch not only must meet ifne needs of 1942 but md^ sCrnTchow be made Lo last initiK we can get adequate ]iioductioii ^f synthetic lubber and substantially greater imports fiom Latin Ameiica. Reclaimed Rubber To Be Used Thoie IS only one source of rubber aside from tlie scant contribution of Latin Ameiica and of Africa, whicli will help meet some of our requncments. It is reclaimed lubber. Reclaimed inbber comes from out-woin tiles, discarded galoshes, discarded lubber ti aiismission belts in industiy--even your children’s abandoned rubber toys. It is repro-
cessed in plants equipped for that pinpo.se, makes our stock pile of lubber about 30 per cent larger than it otheiwise would be. But, a.s with synthetic rubber and natural rubber from such sources as the Guayule Plant, reclaimed rubbei does not solve the pioblem of the civilian motorists. Reclaimed rubber can be used oiiljl foi a limited number of purposes unless it is foi titled with ciude rubber, and even when so fortified otfeis no prospect of sturdy tires. But it is still impoitant thgt we get as much of this rubber off the’scrap heaps and back to the processing plants as we possibly can—important because our militaiy needs require every pound of every soi t of rubber we can scrape up. Into every new battleship of our
expanding Navy goes at least 76 tons of rubber, or the equivalent of 17,143 automobile tires. A single 10-ton pontoon bridge eats up 3,200 pounds of rubber, and .021 pounds are used in each roll of adhesive plaster made for the Aimy Medical Corps. There is more than two pounds of rubber in every Army raincoat, and every man in the Army must have a raincoat. Into the carriage of a single 75MM gun goes more than 175 pounds of riibbtr. Before you can have a scout car you ^nust first have 398 pounds of new rubber. Tires for our fighting aircraft consume from 33 to 96 pbunils. Rubber is used to bullet-proof tanks in fighting aircraft, and because they are made from a petroleum or coal tar base, synthetics are
even better than natural rubber for this pill pose. To bullet-proof the gasoline tank on a Flying Fortress requires 1,246 pounds of rubber. There is 29 pounds of rubber in pneumatic rafts earned by long range bombers. Rubber In Gas Masks ‘ 'fhere is almost two pounds of lubber m any aimy gas mask and SIX pounds of lubber in an aveiage domestic washing machine would make three such masks. There is no desire to see civilian use of wheels on rubber cease altogether. On the contrary, the continued and patiiotie use of rubber is vital to the success of our war effort. We face the compulsion of making what use we can of the rubber we have, to make that rubber last
as long as it possibly can, to make it do as big a job as possible. Cuuperatiun Necessary This means pooling the use of cais, it means that the man who rules to business without other passengers than himself is betraying his country’s war effort to the extent of the seats in his car which lemaiii unoccupied. It means thftt the man who speeds, the man who careens around the curves, the men who brakes sharply when a look ahead would have made Such braking unnecessary, is betrayinff the war effort by the amount of rtlbher scraped from his tires. With care, perhaps, a good part of the stockpile entrusted to the Ameiicaa people—the stockpUe an the wheels of American cars-HHftljf last out the war.W

A Second Front. .
The United Nations have been woiking diligently to pioduce a wax of neives with the thieat of opening a second front Now it seems as though the Germans had stolen the march with the beginning of Geneial Rommel’s diive m Aiiica The second tiont that Russia has been begging for was haidlj one m Lybia An all-out battle in Africa would accomplish lust about eveiything that the Allies don’t want It would draw tioops and equipment from the Japanese front It would give the British another wai fai from their home base, again making the supply pioblem difficult It would however give the Germans a second fiont where thev could gam much and lose nothing If they weie able to sweep through Egypt, they could close the Suez canal to the Allies and employ a perfect pincers to the Russian Caucasus Such a movement would also isolate the British foices in India It might even allow the Germans to ]om forces with the Japs If the Germans were unsuccessful, they would lose at most, a not-too-valuable hold on noithein Africa It IS time that the United Nations start an offensive against a little more than German nerves

Purdue University has provided pretty conclusive proof that badly needed production can be handled on a staggered, part-time basis In the university’s machine shop, 175 students work on actual war production, a fixed number of hours per day The total is said to be equivalent to a 75-man machine shop, working full time The same thing could be done by high school students, and by non-in-dustijal workeis willing to donate a part of their spare time to war production—assuming, of course, that <=hops were available, or that big factories weie willing to try the system ^Port Wayne News-Sentinel

WASHINGTON, May 28—As the tires on youi car wear smoothei, you aie wondering what has hap pened to the ambitious plans for production of synthetic rubbei announced so reassuringly by Jesse Jones months ago Well the unfortunate answei is “Theie just ain’t going to be moie rubbei foi civilian use until 1944 ’’ Reason is the big wai piogram, the long time r6 quired to build factoiies, but also the inexcusable bickering of rubbei experts over contiacts and pio cesses—-especially over the use of alcohol or petiol eum as a base for synthetic i ubbei And behind this is a basic three way struggle among (1) the oil companies, (2) the f?irm belt, which wants to turn its silrplus gram into alcohol, and (9) the big eastern alcohol companies which don’t want to jeopardize their investments in Cuban molasses as a source of alcohol To get the full pictuie, examine the backgiound of the Governments two leading rubber expeits E R Wcidkin advisor to Jesse Jones and the Rubbei Reserve Coipoiation comes fiom the Mellon Insti tute of Pittsburgh, with a big business viewpoint and an oil compnnv hi is as to whether peti oleum oi al cohol IS the bettei i aw mateiial loi svnthetic rub bei The other chief luhbei expert is Aithui Newhall, Cooidinatoi of Rubbei foi the WPB, foimoily with B F Goodiich, and indocti mated with the viewpoint of the big 1 ubbei companies Newhall was pointedly ciiticized by the Tiuman Committee this week
