Woody Herman Flying Cadet Board Maybe Huey Was Right
Will Play Blues Will Accept Student ToEndAIIBIues Applications Today
By Jane Ramsdell Blues will disappear as Prom goers surrender to the distinctive styled music of "The Band That Plays' the Blues." This form of music developed by Woodrow Wilson Herman, popularly known as Woody Herman, was adapted from the secular wailings of the Negro folk songs. Whether its melodic, hot, or 'sweet the blues idiom prevails. Originating just before the Civil War, the blues offer a chance for interpretation according to the mood of the player or singer. Playing together co-operatively in organization as well as composiThree hundred juniors bought tickets to the Prom yesterday. Ticket sale to juniors^ continues today and tomorrow.
tion, this is the most youthful grohp of musicians in the big name bands. Woody himself is only 26 and the oldest member of the band is 30. Agreeing to stick together, a group of players began this organization on a co-operative basis. According to this arrangement they could fire Woody tomorrow if they so desired. Besides featuring the blues, Woody does quite an effective job composing tunes in that form. Outstanding in this group are “Woodchopper’s Ball,” "Blue Even’in’,” "Twin City Blues,” “Blues Upstairs and Downstairs,” and “Blues on Parade.” Deadline For Entries In Bill Stout Contest Set For Next Monday Entries for the Bill Stout technical essay contest will be accepted by the judging committee up to and including Monday, April 7, according to word received yesterday from Professor H.

'Virginians'To Play AlPIA Spring Dance Friday In Ballroom Returning to the campus after & fine reception two years ago at the Forestry Ball, Ace Brigode will bring his "Virginian” band to the PIA Spring Dance Friday evening. This dance will be in both ballrooms and is open to all students, nonmembers paying the usual mixer fee of one dollar.1 Damon Elder, PIA Social Chairman announced last night the backdrop that is being prepared by his committee.

The other two performances will be open to the public and the tickets are on sale for one dollar. Convocation tickets Will not be honored at either performance.
One of the well reiinembered and often quoted statements of the late Senator Huey Lon^ was “When Fascism comes to the United States it will be called anti-Fascism.” The statement has been bandied about considerably and employ^ by a great many people who have opposed some of the policies of the present government. Because of our belief that national defense was the No. 1 issue before the people of the United Slates we have refrained from criticism of certain government policies. However, in the interests of the ultimate preservation of the ideals we are arming to defend it now seems wise to carefully analyze certain dhngerous trends which have crept into the policies of the powers that be. The organization of a powerless strike mediation board, the ^setting up of the all-important Office of Production Management limited by presidential strings may have no significance in the history of a nation about to enter a war but it certainly is worth thinking about. This is particularly true when certain men close to the White Hopse have endorsed such a plan as that embodied in Clarence Streit's “Union Now.” As we interpret the reviews and excerpts of this doctrine it would merely substitute British and American fascism for that of
the Axis.
i The concentration of executive power and the cutting of legal red tape are deemed by everyone to be essential to the end of preparing for America’s defense. But have the men of the United States become so weak and sick of brain that they cannot handle the technical problems of their own industries whose production and efficiencies lead "the world ? We think not. With regard to the labor situation, it was apparent two months ago to a great many industrialists and even the general publiq that some quick and decisive action should be taken with regard to strikes. The presidential answer was the weakly constituted strike mediation board. If we were analyzing motives we’d be inclined to guess that the board was created as a scapegoat or excuse for the eventual declaration of an emergency and the attendant governmental control of industry. The governmental control of industry is justifiable in time of emergency but w'e would certainly object to such a move if it were used to arouse the emotions of people who still believe that the United States can remain at peace. Perhaps it is presumptuous for ns to be critical of men in high places particularly in troubled times and yet there comes to mind a bit of paradoxical wisdom transmitted at the parental knee to the effect that the moment a man thinks himself indispensable he is no longer of any service.

Draftees Weather First Shock Of Physiral Preparedness Course
By L. M. Stettenbenz The University’s Preparedness Course in physical education is well under way, and the third floor of the Fieldhouse yesterday rocked with the groans of spirited lads who have signed up for the ordeal. So far, only the qualification tests have been held. \ This, afternoon’s group was notably proficient in the gentle art of “goldbricking,” for it was infallibly observed th^t any intense activity immediately ceased as soon as the instructor^'s eyes roved to another position, until eventually the only flicker of motion to be noticed, came from the comer where Larry LaBree’s closely supervised jumping examination was in progrress. Meek Bunch The gang was a meek lot; exhitf^ itin^ at first some of the passive lesistance ma^e famous by India’s Mr. Ghandi. Cjoerced into activity, the boys took their places on the floor and spent a brisk fifteen minutes effecting some half-ljeart^d push-ups and bending exercises. Already the strain began to teH for
more than one brow was fervently mopped and agonized grunts, mingled with card room vernacular started to take shape. The jumping exercises came next, offering a slight respite from the initial endeavor. The candidates lined up and valiantly attempted to scale the side of the gym with one powerful leap. The maximum attained was something under twenty-six inches. In an effort to increase the record, the men were instructed to doff the extra weight of their shoes and try again, but the added perils _of ankle socks on a varnished floor brought its just quota of spills and no better showing, so the entire project was dropped. « Chins Up The show went on, and the news was gently broken to the perspiring semi-circle that tq further qualify for entrance in the main bout, they would be required to demonstrate their efficiency on the cross bar. Nothing much, shrugged the in- . structor, merely a few chinnipgs. Try doing a dozen.
One hardy soul, broad in the beam but less comparably so in the shoulders, gripped the bar in desperation and struggled fiercely to rise, but years of physical stagnation and the pull of gravity triumphed and, he stayed on the ground. Whereupon the class, vitally interested in the percentages of . improvement upon which the course grade is based, began to ponder on the degree of advancement he was in a position to obtain if he could but increase his score to one. General Condition O. K. On the whole, the boys aren’t doing so badly, for the average physical condition of the class is surprisingly high, according to the athletic departipent. They are going to be divided into four separate groups, each according to his status of proficiency, in order that there will be no glaring differences in the various. sections. In that way the greatest amount of consistent improvement will be noted, and the ipost additional help will be available to those who need it.
Season At Contest ' With Northwestern The University’s speech team will debate again today for the last time at Noithwestern University. This tournament will include all other members of the Big Ten except Michigan and each school will debate four others. The question for debate will be Resolved: That the nations of the Western Hemisphere should form a permanent union. This debate will be the climax of the season.

Leifheit was credited with the win. The Boilermakers made it three in a row ovei the cadets largely because of the fine all around play of John Emmert In addition to cracking out a home run, he did a nice job of relief pitching by relieving Blanken in the 6th inning Byelene, erstwhile football star, found his batting eye and slammed out two doubles Resistance at Auburn Moving^ on up to Auburn the next day the Riveters ran into a little difficulty with the Alabama team, losing 13 to 1 Byelene’s triple was the only highlight in this game In the second game Leifheit and Blanken completely handcuffed the Engmeeis, gaining a two to nothing

Purdne’s Interesting 0 .People By Donna Siess 13 Parade She’s got an itch. Not measles. Not even the seven year. It’s called wanderlust. Or the. itching foot of those who long for far off places. All tills belongs to Mary, Lou Wheatley, transfer student from St. Mary of the Woods, who is second hit in the 13 parade. Mary has collected shoe dirt from every state in Uncle Sam’s domain except Florida. She has set foot on John Bull’s Canadian land and on Mexico. Favorite with her thus far in her travels is New Orleans in all its old world glamour. India Calls She hopes to do a lot more wandering and tops on her list of “musts” is India. “I’ve heard so many terrible stories about India that I want to see if they’re true,” stated this red-head. The Irish blood in her veins possibly accounts for her second choice for travel— Ireland. Doll Collector Dolls collected by Mary Lou give proof of her widespread tickling' of Uncle Sam’s surface. She chooses these to represent various sections of the country. At present Mary is enrolled in the Home Economics school, majoring in Institution. Later Dad may buy a tea room, while Mary takes over the management. That is, if the itch can’t be scratched. -—yours for more interest—

Spain'^ Exiles Cling To Internment Camp Despite Its Misery By Paul Ghaii SPECIAL RADIO To Chicago Daily News Foreign Service. Special Dispatch from Staff Correspondent. Vichy, April 1.—How much human beings can suffer for ideals can be realized by visiting the two French concentration camps for foreigners at Argeles-Sur-Mer and Le Vernet. Le Vernet, in Ariege Department, is the last European haven of German Jews and anti - Nazis. Camp Argeles houses Spanish Republicans. Since 1938 When Spanish militiamen first crossed into France in 1938, they were concentrated on the long stretch of sand lying east of the little seaside resort of Argeles near Perpignan. The French government hastily built a few wooden barracks, hoping soon to be rid of these unwanted guests. But today 7,000 Spaniards and about 3,000 members of the former International Brigade still live there, and the barracks have hardly been improved. Food Scarce ^ Argeles is a veritable camp of “Don Quixotes.” With French supplies getting scarcer every day, the Spaniards here have taken on that “Don Quixotic” appearance Spaniards get when they have too little to eat—dirty and unshaven. 50 Housed in One Hut On their last week’^ trip to the ■five largest of the French concentration camps for foreigners, American correspondents were permitted to enter only one barrack during a brief visit to Argeles. It was a low wooden hut, 10 yards by four, with dingy ceiling and walls and no elec-

trie light. And 50 Spaniards slept there,*bn wooden bunks. These barracks have no kitchens; food is brought into camp in rolling kitchens and the men sit on their bunks to eat. At Argeles, women and children live in a different section of the camp and their menfolk are permitted to visit them only twice a month—^providing conduct has been good. The Spaniards are allowed to enlist in workers’ companies, recently organized by the French government and there they can earn 6 francs (nominally about 12% cents) a. day. » Three years of this life has developed an extraordinary community of feeling among these men. Two days previous to the visit of the American press, all the Aiembers of the International Brigade, excepting Germans and Italians, were told they would be transferred to North Africa. The Germans

and Italians refused to let their comrades leave. A riot broke out in the camp. Two guards were wounded. Tough Boys Inmates of Argeles, in spite of lack of food, are tough. And they have only one fear-and one hope. Their fear is that they may one day be handed over to Francisco Franco, Spain’s caudillo. Their hope is
that they can get to Mexico. By a recent agreement, they were given the option of retuniing to Spain but few availade themselves of this offer, which was not accompanied by a Spanish promise of amnesty. Mexico has already managed to ship 20,000 and is-will-ing to take® another 30,000. But Spain is putting constant pressure on France not to let them go.
Three weeks ago Spain made it clear, through German channels, that shipment to Mexico must stop because Spaniards already there were propagandizing against Gen. Franco. Today France will not permit men of military age—between 18 and 47—to leave the country. This includes most of these wretched Argeles inmates.

Dr. Perrin H. Long ToTalkToSigmaXi On Chemotherapy “Recent Advances in Bacterial Chemotherapy with Special Reference to the Mode of Action of Sulfanilamide and its Derivatives” is the subject of an address by Dr. Perrin H. Long, Associate Physician and Associate Professor of Medicine at Johns Hopkins University, Thursday evening in the lecture room of Stanley Coulter Hall. The meeting is sponsored by the University chapter of Sigma Xi, science honorary. Although a great interest has been shown in the use of sulfanilamide and its derivatives in the treatment of many bacterial infections, until the present time the manner in which the chemical compounds act upon the bacteria has not been understood. It is generally conceded that the drugs inhibit the growth of susceptible bacteria and that under certain conditions they may even kill the bacteria. Nominations for new members of Sigma Xi must be in the hands of the secretary before April 5. Nominatiori blanks may be obtained upon request from the secretary, R. C. Corley, w.m.c. Dr. R. C.
