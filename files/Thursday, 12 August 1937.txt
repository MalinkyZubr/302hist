Radiography Class Visits institutions At Chicago
Seven students comprising the University class in radiography visited several hospitals and the General Electric X-ray plant at Chi' cago last week-end, with Professor Klemme in charge. One of the highlights of the tour was an inspection of an 800,000 volt X-ray machine used for radiation therapy at the Mercy hospital.
Of the seven students taking the course, three are being sent here by the department of health of the state of Pennsylvama. The class studies the theory and technique of X-ray work.

Duke U. Lends Impression Of Beauty But Ws Unsolvahle To The Stranger

To the unimformed 6Visitor Duke University is beautiful and very impressive hut still an unsolvahle maze. The most remarkable thing about this university is its carefully planned compact campus with every building styled in the same
Gothic architecture.
The many buildings, all constructed from the same materials and all looking very much alike, Ure situated around a large quadrangular court. They are all quite close together—in fact, there are only seven places around the court titet the buildings are not connected together. Must be a fine place on a rainy day.
We arrived on the campus as tota]( strangers having absolutely no knowledge of the layout. Only one building was immediately identifiable—^tbe chapel. To us this was by

AI the iouth end of the
of what we later learned were dormitories—all joined together and built around three sqdare courts. Still ignorant of what we were seeing we spied a sign half hidden by bushes.
“Well,” we thought, “thafs a break. Now we can find out just what these buildings are.”
Walking closer to the sign we read the enlightening inscription, “This way to buildings R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, and AA.”
Then we admitted we were licked and finally after inquiring around n bit, we found the Union building and procured some literature which luckily included a map of the cam-

Youth Is Killed Instantly By Monon Freight Train
Eugene Graves, 11-year-old son of Mr. and Mrs. Esmore Graves, of 215 Ellsworth street, was killed instantly and badly mangled by a southbound Monon freight train just beyond the intersection of Fifth and Alabama streets about 10:20 o’clock yesterday morning. Crossing Fifth street from the east side, the boy ran directly in front df the locomotive, perhaps without seeing it, according to witnesses, was knocked down by the pilot and run over by the engine and six cars. His left arm was severed, his right leg cut off between the knee and thigh, and his left leg was disjoined at the thigh. A fifth grade pupil at Tippecanoe Zchool, Graves was engaged' in selling ice cream on the streets and in business houses this summer. He was carrjiing a box of jee cream and had $2.93 in his pocket when killed. Knapp Atfehds Conference Of Radio Representatives Prof. W. A.

How Do You Uke Our New Face? With this issue of the Exponent we are introducing the brand new display face that will be used in the headlines of the paper during the coming year. Erbar Medium Condensed type, in which the majority of the headlines of today’s paper are set, was first bfought before the publishing world in the May-June issuaof the Linotype News, published by the Mergenthaler Linotype Company, designer of the new face. The main heads of the two outside column stories are in 28 point Erbar Medium Condensed, while the sub decks are in 12 point Metro Medium. Heads on the top stories of the second-to-outside columns are in 18 point Erbar Medium condensed, but the two column head at the top center on page one is in an old face, Casloil italic . Erbar Medium Condensed heads are distributed throughout the paper in 18,24 and 2S point sizes. And while we are talking about ourselves, we want to let you know that the^ Summer Exponent, attempted on a trial basis for the firat time during a Summer Session, has operated so successfully t^at it will be continued' in folowing summers. Grades Fall As Temperature Soars Last night’s showers may prove a godsend to University students burdened with final examinations this week. If the weather clears up and stays fairly cool, the rain was certainly weU timed. A sultry atmosphere not only induces in-

Seasonal variations in empoyment show that although the thoughts c>f a perspiring public seldom touch on such items as candy, furs, furnaces, and coal supply during the hot days of August, it is in that month industries which produce these commodities increase their pay rolls and begin to arise from the depths of their slack season. At the same time a few other lines such as beverages, ice cream, and dairy products, having reached their peak of activity during July, begin the long curve d^nward and normally Show a slight decrease in the number of employees. The Indiana State Employment Service reports that 37 Hoosier industries may be expected to expand and 14 to contract employment two per cent or more during August in comparison with July levels. Lines of industry which, according to employment service charts, show the greatest per cent of increase in employment during August and the percentage of change from July include: canning, 177.7 per cent; con*fectionery, 24.6; fertilizers, 11.4; stoves, 9.6; theatres, 8.6; food preparations, 6.9; bituminous coal mining, 6.6; fur goods, 6.6; street, road, and sewer construction, 6.2; plated ware, 5.8; wirework, 4.3; and radios and phonographs, 4.1; agricultural implements, 4.0; plumbing and steam fitting, 3.6. Four weeks is a short enough time for working, much less looking for a job, but these statistics may help a few students in finding employment.

(Editor’s Note: In her last letter from University of riichiKan Sommer School, Dorothea Instin, associate co-ed editor . of toe Exponent, tells of the recreational I side of life at the Wolverine institution.) Dear Rip: Truly Michigan students have various ways of amusing" themselves. Of course, I speak from hearsay; I haven’t done any real research on the matter! Aside from their studies, and serious pursuits in activities, there are many accepted ways of spending leisure time. First and foremost is holding forth at the Bell to groups of friends happily imbibing beer. > There are dances each Friday and Saturday night at both the men’s Union and the women’s League. The League has the frostier atmosphere and the quieter crowds, usually. The Union is less formally decorated, with somfewhat smaller ballroom, and larger foyers. Sumiher session dances are held alternately at unions, since the crowds aren’t large enough to use both buildings each week-end. The same orchestra plays for all the dances. Theory O. K., But. . . A system of hostesses to introduce people is presumably used during summer. The “hostesses” go, however, to get dates themselves, and rarely arrange introductions. The theory is admirable, the practice dismaying to all stags. The Purdue ballroom is as lovely —we must be gentle with Michigan —as either of the Michigan dance floors. And our Union is much more

Although there is aswimming.pool

Alice Faye, Ameche, Ritz Brothers Star In Zanuck Movie At Mars “You Can’t Have Everything,” a Twentieth Cfsntury-Fox production starring Alice Faye, the Ritz Brothers, and Don Ameche, will open Sunday at the Mars Theatre. The picture is built around the career of playwright Faye and her attempt to meet the successful author of musical comedies, Ameche. The Ritz Brothers furnish the comedy relief, while Louise Hovick, who is making her first screen performance, Rubinoff and his violin, Arthur Treacher, Tony Martin and others furnish a continuous round of singing and dancing. Raryl F. Zanuck directed the production.
one could answer my question, “What if the women undergrads owned the cars ?” The rule is ignored occasionally when some gallant takes a Michigan woman to Westwood Gardens, a place about 12 miles out of town where well known orchestras play. Vincent Lopez was there last week. Comparatively few students have an opportunity to hear these bands however. Mosquitoes Are A Drawback Consequently, the Arboretum, several acres of gardens, used as a plant nursery and laboratory, owned by the University, is extremely popular. From vivid descriptions of girls in the dorm, couples swarm the grounds admiring the rare plants, the superbly wooded areas, the moon, and each other. Many insects thrive in the dense plant life.

dragon flies, develop a great drawback to an Arboretum date, regular
Michigan students say.
I told a bacteriologry professor that Ann Arbor should get rid of its mosquitoes, and he was of the opinion they were a “damn fine tkng in th? Arboretum.” There are two theatres near the campus, usually patronised by students. Tlie vast chmjpus to stroll throhgh, the wonderful libraries to iread ih, and the student given pleys to go, to i^bont complete the list of ordinary pks^es.

Well, it’s all over. For eight short weeks we have been trying to put out a damn good column. Whether we succeeded or not is beside the point. We appreciate your efforts to enjoy our simple puns. But now it’s all over. And are we sorry? Hell, no. Just think, four weeks of actual vacation. This summer school is sure something fine to get away from.

Approval will mark the'end of a six ihohths’ flg^t to > chhfl^e the federal court system. Tuesday President Roosevelt reluctently signed the $132,732,000 interior department supply bill which finances among other things educa tion. Objecting to a $10,000,000 increase in the vocational education fund, which he blamed on a teachers’ lobby, Roosevelt said as much of the money as could be expended wisely and usefully would be spent, “no more and no less.” Administration’s wage and hour bill struck a snag. Scheduled for house debate today it was blocked in the house rules committee apparently by two opponents: the southern industrialists and the farmers. The farmers are clamoring for crop loans. With an American bumper crop now on the stalk, President Roosevelt believes loans would bankrupt the treasury. He is willing to make them only if he gets legislation controlling crop production in the near future. The farmers therefore threaten to hold up the Wagehour labor bill until crop control legislation is written. The southern democrats offer the. other bloc of opposition to the bill. They demand protection for Southern industry from the inqreased wages the hill would bring. Southerners are also revolting against the wage-hour bill in Retaliation for the President’s refusal to prop up the price of cotton with loans. Foreign The conflagration in the Orient spread this week as the China Sea filled with Japanese warships racing toward the mainland. The slaying Monday of two Japanese naval officers by Chinese sentries guarding an aerodrome near Shanghai brought the war threat to central China as Nippon boats and troops swarmed to the scene. Hordes of Japanese and Chinese citizens found themselves living in the wrong countries and prepared to flee to their native lands for safety. Experts believe Japan gained its goal this week when the five provinces of North China, a buffer state against Soviet Russia, were officially possessed. The war fever in both countries, however, allowed no se-

cession of bitterness or preparations for great conflict. Heavy fighting was reported as Nipponese troops moved south from Manchuko and fanned out from Japanese controlled PeipiUg. As Japanese troops lined up" yesterday to attack Nankow, already in flahae^, their linei formed along the ceUturies old tombs of the Ming dynasty. In Peiping, U. S. Marines ignored a Japanese general’s command to cease ph(|tographing maneuvering troops. The general retaliated. He ordered Japanese photographers forward to snapshot the leathernecks. Europe was attentive this week as Great Britain and France cracked ,a whip over Spain. “Shoot down any airplanes attacking British ships at sea” was the order British warships received Monday. France protested Rebel machine-gunning of French ships off Algeria to General Franco. He was warned that hereafter French planes and gunboats would protect French ships. Tuesday Great Britain ordered Spanish Rebel authorities to release three British Merchant ships seized by Rebel warships blockading the Loyalist coasts of Spain. Benito Mussolini observed the day by watching war maneuvers at Messina, Sicily, key location to the Mediterranean trade route. He thundered war oratory to Sicilians at home and abroad.

A fellowIs "dthCfl* good at these things or he isn’t,** so days Bob Quinn, president of tile Boston itradonhls. —fe— In no uncertain terms President Quinn shows why he is President Qtiinn and not IBtenager Quinn. Do you believe for aii instant that 40,060 fans would watch the l^ankees of any other baseball dub play, if the game were as simple as the Bees’ boss would have you believe 1 Not on your life. You and me and your Aunt Kate would have a game of our own. —fc— From Quinn’s statements we can see no reason for having baseball managers or coaches, hat to be sure some of the presidents might still be needed. Maybe the Bees can get along with a few pitchers, batters, baserunners, but we’d like three or four players on our team who could catch a ball now and then, and maybe one or two boys who could throw the ball, and then we could probably use a couple of guys like Bill McKeChnie to do a little thinking for
—fo— The National Baseball Association doesn’t help to maintain a score of minor leagues just for the fun of it. No siree. Before players advance very far in organized baseball they are taught that good pitching means more than throwing a ball across the middle of a rubber plate, that good batting means more than just hitting the ball, and that good baserunning is something more than running 90 feet in nothing flat. —fe— Last Friday members of the Chicago Cubs received gold good luck charms bearing the resemblance of Amelia Earhart. That afternoon Uie Bruins took both ends of a twin hill from Boston. —^fc— ^ The Milwaukee, Wis., school board is to be congratulated on its, efforts to give its school children a real chance to learn how to play’ basebalL The school officials have employed an old Chicago White Sox player ot conduct a'haseball school player to conduct a baseball school year and through the entire summer.

In the Ti^ i6to cehtury ,tw0 brothers came to America from Krance; they had /a land grant ih Louisiana. One bf t^ brothers stopped off at New Orleans and picked up a wbmatt at bnd of the quadtodk baUs there. Whifh women ■v^ete scarce in this new land, and the French held no racial prejudices, sb Vidal took her with him into north erh Lbuisiaha which -was a t^ilder^ ness at that time.
When Vidal died he left; all bf his wealth to Ms “free-iriiilatto” chil dreh; they in turn married women whom they brought from New Or leans and Opelousas. They were wealthy, and they had their own language and culture.' Th^ came the GiVil War which'tuineid the mu lattoes financially just as it did the whites. Some of them left and went to the cities of the iTo^th, to California, to Mexico; those who re mained in Louisiana grew; poorer and poorer, finding it harder and harder to keep their pride and tra ditions, their land and the few possessions which they had left.
The heroine and central character of the book is Famie Vidal (Euphemie in full) great-great-grand daughter of the first Vidal. Sixiteen and the prettiest girl in the mulatto community, she attends the catholic school and helps her grandmother do ironing for Miss Adelaide at the Big House.
