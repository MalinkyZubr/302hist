International Order Needed—Odegard
Young Plays Friday Night For Mixer Majors In Music
“The future of civili25ation , depends upon a regime of international law and order,” stated Dr. Peter Odegard, Ohio State University politi- * cal scientist, speaking on the question, “Is War Inevitable?” at the second forum of the Summer Session. About 100 persons attended the informal discussion yesterday afternoon in the faculty lounge of the Union Building. The session was * conducted under the guidance of Dr. Kirk Porter, forum-discussion leader from the University of Iowa, who acted as chairman.. Even though Dr. Odegard painted a rather gloomy picture of the future of peace, he classed himself as a “hopeful.” Defining the present political state as a “monopoly of violence,” Dr. Odegard doubted whether life, peace, and happiness could continue as long as that monopoly was confined to national boundaries. . Need International State The size of the political state holding monopolistic powers over violence has so increased through the centuries, the speaker stated, that it is now necessary to have * such power invested in an international state. “We need a world community,” declared Dr. Odegard. “I think f the League of Nations still has a lot of life, and can be expected to figure in future peace developments. We can’t live any longer ^ in isolation; it just isn’t possible.” “Some say that war is an inborn human trait, and that we will always have war because of this in- ^ stinct, but I believe that wars occur for the same reason that other conflicts occur. The basic desires— the fulfillment of which results in , war—are prestige, security, and anti-social satisfaction.” Dr. Odegard says economic founr dations for a new and more peaceful order are now being laid, and cited the trade agreements of Secretary of State Hull as an example. ^ In the following panel discussion, ^ .he was asked about increasing of armaments for defense as an insurance of peace. He replied that , defense was needed only in time of war and that increased armaments probably would only result in defense of the United States on European ground or that of some ^ other continent. In an admittedly paradoxical statement, he said one of the most wholesome things of recent weeks has been the mobili- ^ zation of the Czech army. Friday Showers Cause > Picnic Postponement/ Program Is Unchanged j Bain did, not whet the appetites of the picnickers who had planned an outing last Friday. The post- ^ poned festival is now set for Friday, July 8, at Ross Camp, starting at 4 o’clock and lasting until 7. ' A variety program is in store for the picnickers. Games of various sorts, swimming, and a picnic sup- ^ per are features of the affair. Tickets may be purchased at the Union desk for 35 cents. Those bought f last week are still good.

217 Directors Of Personnel Finish Session Saturday Dr. Walters Elected Secretary; Block Co. Man Named President After four days of round table discussions, speeches, and business sessions, 217 personnel directors and industrial executives brought their 1938 annual Personnel Institute to a close Saturday. At a session of the Ipdiana Personnel Association last Thursday afternoon Charles W. Jones, general superintendent of the Wm. H. Block Co., Indianapolis, was elected president and W. S. Gundeck, of the Studebaker Corp., was named vice president. H. O. Roberts, retiring president was made director for three years, ■\yhile Dr. J. E.

The last morning session of the Institute Saturday was given over to a series of round-table discussions on the work and the organization of foremen’s club in various industrial centers. A noon luncheon, presided over by Amon Swope, associate professor of trade and industrial education at Purdue, officially ended the conference. A. A. Nichoson, of the Texas Company, New York, spoke at the luncheon on the subject “New Trends Demand Foremanship Responsibilities.” The discussions of the morning session were led by Warren A. Pease, director of vocational education and secretary of the Evansville foremen’s club, A foremen’s club within an industry was discussed by Clifford Bougher, general foreman for the Sheet and Tin Mills, division of Carnegie-Illinois Steel corporation of Gary, and Lowell ‘Dowdell, assistant to the president of the McGill Manufacturing company at Valparaiso, applied the general organization features of his representative foremen’s club to other clubs in small cities.

Kidd Describes Challenge Of Cancer For Convo Audience “Just remind yourself that 200 people have died of cancer in this country since most of you had your dinner last evening!” emphasized soft-spoken Rockefeller Research Director John G. Kidd yesterday morning as he described the “Challenge of Cancer” for 500 convocation-goers assembled in Fowler Hall. In beginning the second summer convo program. Summer Session Director Knight told the audience, “We have no professional lecturers scheduled for these convos; but instead we have invited distinguished scholars.” Dr. Kidd admitted he was no pro.fessional lecturer and then began the theme of his speech, telling the history and progress of cancer in popular and non-technical phrases. “Medicine’s attitude toward cancer is profoundly pessimistic !” Dr. Kidd admitted, “but cancer is not the first disease to cause that attitude. Tuberculosis used to be a hopeless mystery 50 years ago. Tuberculosis, Cancer Similar “I mention tuberculosis because its history is very similar to cancer’s. No specific cure for tuberculosis has yet been found, though the cause has been known for 50 years. But the very effective modern means of treating it and the measures taken to prevent it all rest solidly on the knowledge of the cause of the disease. “What must be done eventually to meet the challenge of cancer is to discover its cause . . . and the time may now be ripening for just that discovery.” Science Makes Progress Dr. Kidd told his audience of the progress being made by medical science in the study of cancer both by research and clinical work. He outlined research methods and told how cancer could be produced at will in the laboratory by three different methods, but also showed how these methods did not disclose the fundamental cause. “Cancer may be more properly considered'as a group of related diseases with a common cause,” Dr. Kidd stated. He also made it clear that cancers found in laboratory animals are identical with those which attack human beings. New Buildings Rise On Boih Campuses As Purdue Grows By W. R. Smith Associate Editor Purdue is a growing institution, and, as with other growing things, constant adjustments for its new size are necessary. An afternoon hike around our campus reveals the changes taking place in our physical plant. Of course there are the normal repairs and maintenance but, in addition, on the North and South campus we see new landmarks. To the South are the new Agricultural Chemisfry Building and the Horticulture Building addition. The Horticulture addition was made possible through the cooperation of the state legislature by the appropriation of $175,000. The entire third floor of this building will be occupied by the forestry department, while the second floor will house the horticulture department of research. The first floor will consist of classrooms and an auditorium to seat 250 people. Department Will Pay Bill The Agricultural Chemistry building will cost $150,000, and oddly enough will be paid for by the department’s own operations. For many years there has been a growing operation control fund. This fund originated from the sale of certified seed tags and fertilizer tags. All Agricultural Chemistry will be housed in this building, will no longer {Continued on page 4)
Greorge W. Campbell George W. Campbell, above, one of the outstanding song leaders of the Middlewest, will direct the summer’s first outdoor sing tomorrow night in Ross-Ade stadium. Campbell for many years was a YMCA secretary and director of music at George Williams College, one of the YMCA training institutions. He served as chairman of the music committee of the Kiwanis International, and is now giving his entire time to leadership of musical groups in many types of conferences and conventions. Respect The Past Is Plea Of Bishop Hugh es At Convo Former DePauw Head Inaugurates Summer Religious Program “It is the blood of Christ that has made us what we are,” declared Senior Bishop Edwin Hughes, of Washington, D. C., Sunday afternoon in the first of a series of religious convocations for University Summer Session, in Eliza Fowler Hall. The former DePauw University president pointed out many gifts, skills, and inventions that have been handed down to the. present generation from ^previous ones. Speaking of tributes that are being paid to great men g^pd women of the past and especially in the field of religion, Bishop Hughes said, “Sometimes I think anniversaries are good for us cock-sure people.” Respect The Past Summarizing his plea, he asserted, “Have no attitude of disrespect for the past, because from the past we have received literally floods of benefits, without which we could never have made any progress.” Assistant to the President Frank Hockema introduced the bishop. Religious hymns were sung by the Summer Session choir under the direction of Music Leader A1 Stewart.
Publication Dates The Exponent will be published on the following dates during the Summer Sessionr July 1, 7, 14, 31, and 28; and August 4 and 11.
Campbell To Lead Singing Of Favorites
Inaugurating the summer outdoor program series, the first Summer School sing will be held tomorrow night in Ross-Ade stadium, beginning at 8 o’clock; under the direction of George W. Campbell, nationally known song leader. In case of rain, however, the program will be conducted in Eliza Fowler Hall. The change will be made if rain falls after 4 p. m., according to announcement made last night by Albert P. Stewart, University director music. If it should rain only previous to that hour, the sing will be held in the Stadium anyway. ' Crowd Gets Choices l?o set program of songs has been arranged. Instead Campbell will feel out the crowd and attempt to have its choices followed. The summer chorus, composed of 50 students, will sit on a stage and supply background to the community singing. As an added feature of the evening, the Oxford Choir, from Oxford, Ind., will sing three selections, one of which will be the Blue Danube Waltz. For this piece an accompaniment of two violins, a flute, and a piano has been arranged. Mrs. Vera Vickers will lead the Oxford singing group. Robert A. Phillips, student director of the University orchestra, will be the accompanist for the community singing which will occupy most’-'of the evening. Songs both old and new will find a place in this part of the entertainment. R. E. Girton Talks Tonight In Series Of Science Chats Professor R. E. Girton, of the biology department, will give the second summer science “chat” tonight at 7:30 o’clock in the faculty lounge of the Memorial Union Building. His subject will be “Stephen Hales—^Father of Plant Physiology.” The life and work of Hales will supply the theme for Professor Girton’s talk. “Hales has the title of father of plant physiology, but he also was a student of animal physiology,” stated Girton in discussing his talk last night. “He was a famous clergsrman who lived in the 17th and 18th centuries.” Summer Registration Totals 1,448/ Expected To Pass 1,500 Mark Registration in the 1938 Summer Session has n6w reached the record total of 1,448 students, according to an announcement last night by Assistant Summer Session Director G. E. Davis. A new group of students will come to the campus after next week to em“oll in the set of threeweek intensive courses beginning then. These newcomers are expected to swell the registration figme to well over 1,500.EDITORIAL
THE PURDUE SUMMER EXPONENT
HUMOR
Tuesday^ June 28, 1938
Moving Day . .
, . . last Saturday transferred Exponent’s editorial and business offices from Haywood Building on Fifth Street, Lafayette, to rooms D and F of the Memorial Union Building. Thus the paper leaves a location built for it several years ago to take up residence on the University campus.
Not without some regrets, however, are the Fifth Street offices abandoned . . . they had their advantages and they still stir up recollections in the minds of Exponent workers.
Very few persons crossed the Leyee to visit the paper unless they had definite objections or suggestions to offer. Situated now in “the center of activities,” . . . well, we’re wondering. Of course the many students who assist in putting out Exponent will save on car fare. But they’re going to miss those rather pleasant — with the knowledge of getting home to a bed—taxi rides in the small hours of the morning . . . and the tales of taxi drivers.
We’re moving away from the Monon^— with its grinding and clanging that often made telephone conversation impossible, and its omnipresent soot that blackened office walls and equipment. We’ll no longer be able to look out of our window, however, and watch travelers clamber off and aboard the cars . . . we can no longer step outside the office and dispatch a letter by train.
Sudden jerks or halts of Monon freights always brought us to our feet . . . since the day last summer when a jarring stop roused us and took us two blocks south to find an ll-year-old boy decapitated and dismembered by freight car wheels.

Should American athletes be allowed to enter the 1940 Olympics at Tokyo? In a recent editorial the New York Times takes a stand definitely against sending an American team to Japan. The Times says the Olympics have failed to achieve the peace and good brotherhood that they are intended to.
__PC—
Open Letter To New York Times: You overlook the fundamental basis of athletics when you condemn the Olympics. You forget that the aborigines survived only because they had the fight, determination, and nerve to overcome difficulties. You forget that athletics instill these qualities in young men and women. Even if these things were not true, would you spoil the dreams

SUMMER SWING!!
- spare Tirne^prcJnlao/e—wr/fe-us;.
The University team has been practicing every afternoon for several days and has games with some nearby teams in prospect. Captain Pogue boasts three pitchers in line for work in Wadleigh, Massoth, and Chamberlain. Kowalchuk has been doing the receiving. Staff Families Get Use of Pool Sunday The first period for faculty members and their families to use the swimming pool exclusively is next Sunday from 4 to 5 o’clock. Intramurals Director Clevett says that “mothers, fathers, and children of faculty members are invited.” They must bring their own towels and suits. If the hour is well received it will become a regular part of the summer schedule. Any summer students, male or female, who wish to improve their stroke may have special instruction under Chief Clevett at 7 a. m. on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fndays. This period is before the regular class time. Thursday Will Close Entries For Tennis Tennis entries will close this Thursday, Clevett said yesterday. The list for names of those interested in the summer session singles tournament has been on the bulletin board across from the checkout window for over two weeks. Several students have signified interest. Medals will be given for first and second place winners. All-campus mixed doubles will be started in about two weeks. A blank is posted across from the checkout window in the basement of the Fieldhouse for entries. The tennis singles tournament is underway this week. Sports Program May Add Softball Playing If enough interest is shown in forming an interfraternity softball double-elimination tournament, this sport will be added to the summer schedule. Any individual living in a fraternity for the Summer Session, whether a member or not, will be eligible to play for that frater-
nity.
Outside of fraternities, independent groups or houses near the campus may enter. Entry blanks in the form of a list of the names of those interested in playing will be accepted if dropped into the mail box at the intramural office. Awards will be decided upon later.

Education Clinic Will Bring CCC Directors Here TSventj'-eight educational advisers from Indiana’s Civilian Conservation Corps camps will join the ranks of the Educational Leaders Conference at Purdue July 11-16, according to District Education Advisor Robert G. Correll, CCC officer stationed at Ft. Benjamin Harrison. Through this conference the CCC hopes to give its educational leaders, all of whom are college graduates, intensified training in vocational work. Director Correll says. The CCC educational movement IS expanding rapidly and is necessarily changing as it expands, he said. This conference will be one move in the new expansion. Indiana Men Must Register Leaders from Indiana camps will be required to register in the course, attend all of the lectures, perform the required work and take the final examination. Dr. Glenn 0. Emick, corps area advisor of education for the CCC, stationed at Ft. Hayes in Columbus, 0., and Dr. Howard W. Oxley, national director of education for the CCC from Washington, D. C., are also expected to attend the conference. Study Agriculture In addition to the regular work of the leaders’ course, the CCC directors will be instructed in vocational agriculture in order that they may instruct their, youthful charges in practical methods of making their living from the soil. An invitation has been extended to other educational leaders in camps throughout this corps area and a few are expected to attend the conference.
V^BAA Places Three New Programs On Summer Calendar New radio programs that have taken their place in the regular broadcast schedule of WBAA, the Voice of Purdue, are the “Question and Answer” feature and the 15 minute “Curbstone Reporter” program. Both programs are under the direction of Henry Miller, staff announcer for the University station, and originate on the sidewalk of Main Street, between Third and Fourth. The Question and Answer spot is heard on Friday at 12:15. Persons picked at random from the passersby are the object of Miller’s queries. Question Announcer The Curbstone Rporter is heard Saturday at 3:30 in a discussion of items from the day’s news. Each person appearing on either program has an opportunity to ask the announcer a question. Miller says this privilege of the participating person sometimes proves embarras-
sing.
Dr. Edward R. Bartlett, professor of religious education at DePauw University and a prominent state figure in that field, began a series of 15-minute broadcasts over WBAA yesterday. Dr. Bartlett is a member of the University Summer Session staff. His broadcasts, on “This Business of Living,” will be heard each Monday afternoon at 1 o’clock this sum-
mer.

New Buildings Rise - - {Continued from page 1) need to overflow into the Agricultural Engineering Building. On the North campus one may visualize the new Chemical Engineering Building arising acitoss from the Pharmacy Building. It is only waiting on a hoped-for PWA grant from the Federal Government. Cary Halls Take Shape On up the walk the new West and Northwest Cary Halls are taking final shape. Special services are emphasized in the new halls, with an up-to-date grill to serve sandwiches and milk, f(5r a fee, and alongside the grill, a post office. An all-electric kitchen will provide evenly cooked meals. The women will not allow themselves to be out-done by the men and if one should wait for a few weeks for his hike around the campus he would see the start of the third unit on the Women’s Residence Halls. News of a PWA grant for the construction of the new WRH came through yesterday.
Collegiate ^-^ON OTHER CAMPUSES-s
Just a w^eek ago student senators at the University of Illinois approved a fee of up to $5 per semester to provide a student center on the campus. In approving the project of establishing a student fee of $3.50 a semester to provide for a portion of the construction, and to obtain a fund for operation and maintenance of the building, the Illinois senate expressed its opinion that the saving to students would more than offset the fee—which might be raised by a tuition boost. * * * Northwestern University has arranged to sell its famed crime detection laboratory to the city of Chicago, Mayor Edward J. Kelly announced last week.^ It affords facilities for analyzing blood stains, dust particles, food, hair, and poisons, for making casts of teeth and foot prints, and for examining tell-tale powder burns. Also included in its equipment are instruments and ray machines for detecting erasures in printed and written matter and obliterated serial numbers on guns and typewriters. The lab’s lie detector has come into use on a score of cases.
H: *
Prof. Lawrence Zillman, of the University of Washington, takes advantage of his opportunities. A front row student in one of his classes was toying with a wax-paper-wrapped butterscotch when the tasty morsel clattered to the floor, wrapping and all. Professor Zillman was there like a flash to do gentlemanly honors, but imagine the student’s amazement when she saw the paper go fluttering into a nearby wastebasket and the butterscotch pop into the English professor’s mouth in no time at all. * * ^ “I haven’t solved any problems for the girls.” Thus last week Miss Mary Johnson, director of Brooklyn College’s “petting” course, admitted failure in her attempts to help co-eds regulate their private lives. Miss Johnson states the purpose of the course, started a year ago, thus: “I try to help them solve their ovm problems by helping them see both sides of the question.”
CaiinifTig Factory Men Here For Short Course Thirty-two technicians from canning factories of the state were on the campus last week taking a short course relative to their work, under th auspices of the Indiana Canners' Association and the horticultural department of the University. H. R. Smith, of the national canners’ organization, was in charge of the course. He was assisted by Dr. Evans Wheaton and M. A. Hoy, of the American Can Company; Miss Ruth Kirkpatrick, of the Continental Can Company; and Miss Gerti’ude Speiden, of the National Canners’ Association. Some of the canning factory technicians attended a preliminary course held the week before. Others are remaining here this week for more advanced work. Staff Members Visit Annual ASME Session Dean A. A. Potter, of the^^University engineering schools; Prof. G. A. Young, head of the school of mechanical engineering; and Pz’ofs. H. W. Cope and F. D. Ault, of his staff, and Prof. F. C. Hockema, assistant to the president, were in St. Louis last week for the annual meeting of the American Society of Mechanical Engineering.
