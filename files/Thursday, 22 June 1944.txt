PATTIE WEBB Many of you, before leaving for home at jbe end of this semester, will haye to buy graduation presents for friends here or at home who ^ave just finished high school or college. Southtborth’s Gi/t Shop is chuckfull of ^mart gifts. For girls there are compacts, some pretty shell shaped plastic ones, and some darling hand painted natural wood finished ones. Perfume:; especially the dri-perfnme, makes a nice gift for any girl. The silver and rhinestone pins are real super and so are the earrings. They come in all shapes, sizes; artd designs: Stationery, or note paper makes a useful present and unusually appropriate right now when so many letters are heinj^fwritteti, (If you know what I mean.) The Incite dresser'scjts are awfully smart looking and being colorless they will go in with any color scheme. For the fellows, personalized playing cards, bhaying sets, handkerchiefs, ring'g, identification bracelets, and servicemen’s accessories are all practical articles for graduation; hirthday, or going away gifts. , < . Another little i(em that makes a nice gift is a handkerchief. Thibrne and Wangerin hsye a nice supply which would give even the moj|i particular person ample choice. They have prints in bright colors afid pastels which are very attractive, particularly striking are. the large floral designs. Plain white hankies come in handy, tOo, and the white ones initialed ini a height color are,a rather tiscful kind to havehii haii^; Less dressy blit just as yaluablp are the colored initialed handkerchief jit A new type .of footletj called Pedees, is an article you cart buy fhr yopriaelf. They^e a fabric, spug fitting and minus the elastic toh:'which, i8.80.apt.tO:hind/your foot.

Nb ration stamps are necessary, the styles are darling, and the variety to chhdsc from is Mde, Reds and greens seem to be the most popfilbr colors buf thcre are also plenty in .navy, r(>yal, pr light blue, brown, tanyheige, white arid: stripesi vYpU can get open tpes, or opeii heels, iveidges, slipons, sandals, straps, ties, or bows. In fact there are so many styles, knd all of them good, that,, it is really a job to pick the best. Most of the soles are rope or composition and the‘dipper part of the shpes are mostly p heavy linen oir callvas. / The Go/Zegc Shop this week is well supplied.with shorts. My favorites are the shark* ' skin ones in pastel colors—^yellow, povyder blue, pink, and white—^they have some with suspenders and some without. The all around pleated shorts are cute, too, and the gabardine ones are practical although not quite as dressy. Some really sharp playsuits are in all wliite, red, pr hlMe butcher linen. They have large trimmed pockets that give them that certain touch. For practical purposes the cotton playsuits and skirts to match are sensible and they coine in cheeses grid stripes,'both of which seem to be favorite prints, Iri a spft flpweted material there are some shorts, skirts, and halters to match that would be wonderful for hot supimer days.

Iri the music departinent of the Foster Shop you can find some replly ejassy records these days. An album of Glenn Miller includes eight of hisjnost famous recordings such as “Stardust,” “In the Mood,” and “Song of the Volga Boatman.” Anothriit albuip of eight re4ly mdloiv pieces is the pi^gWhurii pf Count Basie. “Back Beat Boogie,” by Harry James and “Trumpet Rhapsody,” by same, are JP beat.

It may be cold around this place one miriute but you can he sure that if it’s June, July, or August, it wori’t be cool long. Therefore, hoeh's would like to outfit you for a day at the beach. Suggestions start with bathing arid sun suite, mostly tWe piece, in^' bright floral designs. The rjyon taffetas and silk jerseys seem especially cool. Bathing ' caps in a water proof fal^iric aren^t guaranteed to keep out all the water hqt they do a pretty good job of it, Bright collored bathingsbags in red, blue and white, or figured, patterns, are lined 'with water proofing and as good as pre.>vor days.
