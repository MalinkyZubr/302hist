PGA Officials, Golf Pros Boilermaker Nine Loses 2-0
Convene At Links Clinic Horton Smith Demonstrates Correct Form Over two hundred golf professionals and coaches representing 15 states and Canada participated in the first educational golf clinic of this type ever held in the history of the sport. The clinic, under ^he direction of the Professional Golfers Association with the Cooperation of the University, marks the first step in the program of the P. G. A. toward encouraging the establishment of a curriculum of golfing in the major universities for young men desiring to become pros. “Speaking as president of the , , —
Professional Golfers Association of America, I wish to say that a revolution has taken place in golfing with this successful meeting at Purdue,” enthusiastically remarked Tommy Walsh, newly elected head of the P. G. A. “We are deeply interested in the outcome of the meeting, and hope that other meetings of this type will be held in all parts of the country,” he added. .Keller, Dyer Speak The tlinic officially got under way yesterday afternoon with an address by chairman Frank Sprogell vice-president of the P. G. A., from Grand Rapids, Mich. The remainder of the ^ternoon sessions included short lectures by Dr. Kelley, of the division of education and applied psychology; Dr. Robert E. Dyer, of Chicago, 111.; and a forum on golf fundamentals conducted by Horton Smith, Tom Walsh, and other pros. Last evening at 7:30 a crowd of nearly two thousand students and visitors joined the clinic for the golf show! Beginning the evening session which was conducted in the western half of the fieldhouse amid a background of artificial greens and bunkers, chairman Sprogell introduced a number of the visiting celebrities, including officers of the various golfing associations and attending pros. Among t|ie outstanding luminaries were the representatives of two Canadian clubs, and the coaches of the Universities of Nebraska and Minnesota golf teams. Smith Classy Horton Smith, one of the outstanding pros of the nation, thrilled the audience with demonstrations of a variety of shots, along with an explanation of the correct form for each shot. Marvin Stahl, Michigan Open Champion, joined Smith in demonstrating the correct form for the various types of shots. Following the demonstrations, the near 250 students who had carried clubs to the clinic were arranged in checkerboard fashion, with the professionals and coaches circulating among the swinging eds and co-eds to give advice toward the improve^ment of the various individual defects. According to President Walsh, the instruction was conducted by the greatest turnout of professional teachers ever gathered in America. More Tomorrow The final feature of the evening was the showing of the motion picture “Keystones of Golf” in the pool gallery. Justin Will Speak At Miller Meeting Miner M.

Hawkeye Pitcher Victorious In Mound Duel; Bailey Gives Five Hits, Strikes Out 8 A chilly breeze failed to cool down the pitching arms of Bail^ of Purdue and Haub of Iowa in yesterday’s game on Ross Meld as these two men staged a pitching duel which finally ended with the Hawkeyes eking out a 2-0 victory to start on their way to their second successive Big Ten title. Bailey gave up just five hits while striking out eight, but was matched by Haub who held the Boilermakers to three hits while marking up 11 strike-outs.
It was clearly a* case of the last out being the hardest. Two of the three hits chalked up by the Boilermakers came after two were out in the last of the ninth inning awakening the hopes of the half frozen crowd, which had already started to leave the bleachers. McFerren, sophomore second baseman, started the belated rally with a drive into centerfield after two pinch hitters had been retired on long flies. Johnny Vernon who had struck out,in his first three appearances at the plate then came uji with a timely single, also to center, moving McFerren over to third base. All Wargo could do, however, was dribble a Weak ball to the pitcher and the game was over. Four Runless Innings In the first four innings neither pitcher was in much trouble with Welp, Hawkeye catcher, getting the only hit during that time. In the first of the fifth Iowa managed to get the first run across on a single by Cook, Y^ho went to second when Fisher dropped the ball on the third S^trike on Kocur. He then advanced to third on a passed ball and came in when Stastny drove a long fly to center field. The second run was scored against Bailey in the sixth when a low throw to first by Hearne let Prasse get on base. Successive singles by George and Welp pushed across the final run. Prasse, incidentally, is the same athlete who was such a thorn in the side of the Boilermakers in both football and basketball earlier in the year. Smithson Gets Hit In the last of the sixth Smithson ended the hitless streak of the gold and black when he got a hit to second that none of the infield could quite get. He was caught off first’, however, and the score still stood at 2-0. In the seventh Bailey came back even stronger than ever, despite his tough luck in the preceding innings and struck out the first two men with just seven pitched balls and the third man flied out. But it was to no avail as the hitting strength which the Boilermakers displayed earlier in the year seemed to completely vanish, and his team-mates failed to supply him with any runs.
George, who collected two of the five Iowa hits, was the leading batter in the conference last season and showed that he is just as tough again this season. The summary: PURDUE AB R H McFerren, 2b 3 0 1 Vernon, cf 4 0 1 Wargo, rf 4 0 0 Mackiewiez, 3b 2 0 0 Hearne, ss 3 0 0 Blanken, If 2 0 0 Smithson, lb 2 0 1 Ridgeway, lb 0 0 0 Fisher, c 2 0 0 Bailey, p . 2 0 0 Young * 0 0 0 Yeager ** 0 0 0 Stamm *** ; 0 0 0 24 0 3 IOWA AB R H Radies, lb 3 0 0 Kantor, ss 4 0 0 Prasse, 2b 4 10 George, cf . 4 0 2 Welp, c 4 0 2 Cook, If .. 3 11 Kocur, 3b 3 0 0 Stastny, rf 3 0 0 Haub, p 3 0 0 31 2 5 * batte(I fqr Smithson in the eighth. ** batted for Fisher in the ninth *** batted for Bailey in the ninth.

Passed balls—^Fisher, Bridge Tournamenl . . . opened last night in the ballroom with forty-seven teams participating. According to the rules of the tournament this year no team is eliminated the first night. On the second night, the teams which have lost two games will be eliminated. The second round will take place April 16, the third, April 25, and the fourth, on May 2. The date for the final round has not yet been decided.
Being A Director Is Fine - As Long As Time Can Stand Still
By Gordon Fletcher Even the great have their embarrassing moments. William Deam, member of the speech department, staff mepiber of playshop, and directorjof a(^ting and dancing for “Sweethearts,” Varsity Show to be presented April 18-20, can testify to that. The following is an eyewitness’ account of an incident that happened at a recent rehearsal. The Account “For some reason several of the principals in the cast were late for rehearsal that night. It was necessary to go over some music before the second act could be practised. Nothing happened until the absent members put in their appearance. Then we ran through the musical numbers. “It was announced that the second act would be put on. I noticed glum looks, and heard several members mutter something about food and emptiness. Then somebody proposed (out loud) that it was dinner time, “Director Deam i^poke up and said that if rehearsals began promptly at 4 o’clock something might be accomplished. It was agi eed by all present that anyone
who was as much as one minute late the next afternoon would buy a chicken dinner (not a candy bar) for all members of the cast. Where’s Deam? “The next afternoon everybody was on time. When we looked around for Mr. Deam to tell os what was to go on first we couldn’t find himj. He just wasn’t there. “Fifteen minutes later he walked in explaining about a faculty meeting he couldn’t leave. Of course we all saw a free chicken dinner in front of us that Very night. But the illusion vanished. We decided that a sweet shop coke would pacify. Later we enjoyed them.”
Sweefhearf Tickets Eight hundred and fifty tickets were reserved yesterday afternoon for Varsity Show’s production “Sweethearts” to be presented April 18-20. Good seats are still afailalila for Thursday and Friday niidtt performances, and a few for Saturday. Tickets may he reserved any afternoon from 3 to S:S0 in Rlayshop’s office in Fowler HalU

Coach Elward Grooms Forces For Saturday's Intra-Squad Tilt With Saturday’s > intra-squad game in view, Coach Mai Elward today sent his squad through an intensive blocking practice session followed by a brief scrimmage. The Riveter squad has been working unusually hard this spring in an effort to groom a green team which has only three men who saw much action last year for an eight game schedule including Fordham, Ohio State, Indiana, and Wisconsin. Right now it looks like the strat-
egy has beei; a success for it has develhped many of the freshman and last year’s reserves into men of varsity caliber. Among the freshmen who have really begun to click are Brock, Anderson, Fijala, Powers, Hillenbrand, Schumacher, while Kersey, Axton, and Sprowl are a few of the upperclassmen who are set for next fall.

Saturday’s competition should offer some interesting action as the gridders already have one game under their belts. The game will be held in the stadium and will be open to the general public. This may be the last chance to see the Riveters in action until the Gala Week game early in May which concludes spring practice .. j

And the Pittsburgh Pirates swoop eastward to take on Purdue’s Boilermakers tomorrow on the RossAde Recreation Field at three bells. And the local lads “sit tight” at home playing Iowa’s Hawkeyes in a two-game series. —^fc— We had a bit of gab with the weather man a few minutes ago about tomorrow’s much-heralded contest and he seemed to be in quite a pesj^imistic mood . . . “It’ll turn cloudy in Dallas, Texas,” said our friend. —^fc— Bill de Correvont, sophomore footballer who is going great guns at Northwestern, doesn’t seem to be satisfied with just steaiqmg up and down gridiron sidelines ... now he’s playing ball and whipping out trouble already. Notre Dame’s hurler, Hunthausen, would’ve had a no-hit, no-run ball game yesterday if “Sweet Willie,” Wildcat centerfielder, hadn’t come through with a single to send a Purple player across the plate in the eighth with the South Benders. Notre Dame won, 6 to 1. —fc— We’re hearing more talk these days about Pittsburgh hopping into Chicago’s berth in the Big Ten, but Michigan State will have a perfect right to ask when, why, and how before the thing blows over, we think

... of the keystone sack. Pep Young IS one of Frisch’s most dependable batters, and teams with Arky Vaughan to give the Pirates a speedy double-play combination. This IS no reflection on any of the coaching staff of the Boilermaker baseball team, but, after''a recent cut of the squad, the Delta Tau Delta fraternity mne was materially strengthened when Ferrel Ruppert, pitcher, and Keigh Correl, catcher, were dropped from the Purdue outfit ... F. R. is a pretty good pitcher — in fact, excellent in fraternity circles — and K. C. should make him an able battery mate for the Delts . . . they’re out for blood, in the Greek circuit, we understand.

Colorful Pre-game Events To Mark Exhibition Game Boilermaker Nine Faces Hawkeyes Today With yesterday’s ball game with last year’s conference champions a thing of the past, Purdue’s baseball week will swing into its second lap this afternoon with the Boilermakers and Hawkeyes staging a repeat performance on Ross-Ade field. Now that the lid if off on this year’s Big Ten baseball scramble all that is needed is a little warmth from Old Sol to make the ball games somethingLmore than a teeth-chattering party.

Sox Beat Pirates Pushing across five tallies in the seventh, the Chicago White Sox triumphed over the Pittsburgh Pirates yesterday afternoon at Owensboro, Kentucky, by a score of 10-7. The Sox led by three runs in the sixth inning by virtue of Ted Lyons’ two hit pitching, but the Pirates got to relief hurler Edgar Smith in their half of the inning for five runs. The Pittsburgh lead was short lived, however, as the powerful bats of the Chicago nine brought the Sox back into the lead. Summary of the game; Chi. (A) 0 0 0 0 1 4 5 0 0 10 12 2 Pitt.

thing less than the downpour which washed out last year’s exhibition ^ame with the Pirates, all indications will point to a record turnout for Friday’s tilt with the Smokey City lads The seating capacity will be increased to 6,000 and advance sales indicate that this will not be any too big Colorful ceremonies will mark the opening of the game. One of the many guests of honor. Governor M. Clifford Townsend, will don a catchers mitt to call the signals for President Elhott’s first pitch. Members of both teams and honored guests will participate in a pre-game flag raising ceremony. Invitations have been issued to all former Purdue major lettermen in baseball to be on hand for the contest, and they will be introduced to the public. In view of the interest which the presence of major leaguers on the campus may create, arrangements have been made to open the gates of the field at 12.30 so that fans may watch the Pirates’ batting and'fielding drill
The 60th annual national archery tournament will be held at Massachusetts State College next August.
