Dorsey's Music To Highlight Union Addition Opening Jan. 31 With the completion of its new million dollar addition, the Union building will be the scene of a gala open house celebration next Wednesday night, January 31. The entire new addition, which includes more space for the cafeteria, student activity rooms, and another ballroom will be open for the first time for student inspection. Playing at the dance arranged for the occasion will be . . .
. . . Tommy Dorsey and his band. Famous as the “Sentimental Gentleman of Swing,” Dorsey hardly needs an introduction to any collegiate audience. For the past few months, Tommy and his orchestra have been playing weekly over a national hook-up. The'Union building will be open to the public without charge but admission to the ballroom will be by ticket only. Tickets may be obtained at the West desk of the Union for $1.60. The bandstand will be set up at the north side of the new addition, at the far end from the main entrance, that is, at the top of the T-shaped floor plan.
40 Students Selected From 200 Applicants For Marriage Course Final selection of the forty students who will make up the class of the experimental marriage course being offered by the University were completed yesterday, and those who have been chosen were notified by mail. Experimental Curriculum The selections were made from approximately two hundred applicants by the student and faculty committee in charge of the course. Selections were made on the basis of what the individuals would contribute to the course. This semester the course is still in the experimental stage and committee in charge is trying to fit the curriculum to what will be practical from the students’ point of view. A cross section of the campus was selected with representatives from every school and as many of the social groups on the campus as possible. Those in charge hope that discussion will not be limited to the classroom, but that those who have the opportunity to take the course will discuss and pass on what they learn to others who have not been able to take the course. , Registration Registration for the course will be the same as for any other course. Those who have been accepted will find the course on their schedule cards, and they will receive class card and follow through the regular registration procedure. A secondary list has been prepared by the committee so that, if for any reason one of the students who has been selected cannot tak-e the course, the quota of forty can be maintained.
Road School Enters 4th Day
Attendants Hear Talks On Highway Spending Problem
33 Commercial Exhibits Crowd Roadshow Display Includes All Types Of Equipment All the accoutrements for a well groomed highway, ranging from huge power shovels and graders to the smallest of precision instruments, went on display in the Armory Tuesday as one of the features of the annual road show. Thirty-three commercial exhibits and a number of educational displays are present for the benefit of the general public, as well as for the Road School attendants. The disijjay will continue through this morning. Road Equipment Snow plows, streamlined tractors. truck mounted power shovels, precision instruments, scarifiers, rollers, various types of culvert pipes, and other types of road equipment on display give some idea of the problems involved in the proper construction and maintenance of
roads.
Numerous interesting and instructive educational displays that attracted considerable attention at the opening of the show supplement the commercial exhibits. Among these is a display by the State Highway Commission with an exhibit of photographs outlining various types of improvements and construction methods which have given Indiana roads a high ranking in the nation.
Enders To Consult Students Interested In Far East History History 130 will be the official title of the subject “Far East Problems,” to be taught for the first time next semester by Gordon En-

Any student who cares to donate time may work. They should report to him in the ballroom Monday, January 29 at 11:30 a. m. Plans have been made to make the Exchknge a permanent activity and juniors and sophoinores who work this Semester will receive consideration for electorial positions next fall.
By Chuck Hart With an eye to the protection of the student body in general from unknown bug-a-boos that might jeopardize the successful culmination of finals, an Exporlent reporter hurried over to the local county jail last night to ascertain the facts surrounding a certain mysterious shooting. Student, take heed! The murderer, when interviewed in his cell, refused at first to give any statements save “Damn finals!” Between spasmodic outbursts of “Damn finals,” the murderer student moaned incoherently to himself. After a master bit of tact on the part of your reporter, he was finally induced to give the details of his dastardly deed.
At first, he cried. Then his mournful tale began. It was like this, he moaned: “I’m a good student. Always conscientious about reports. And grades. And finals. And so I was diligently studying for my final in ME 112 . . “I was studying for my final when my roommate came in and asked me to take a blind date. I can’t date girls. I never could. I’m not a master at social chit-chat and smooth dribble. I’m an intellectual ^nd I deal in abstracts. So I told him I couldn’t take the date. He reminded me of the five bucks I owed him and of the time that he carried me home when I couldn’t— well, I had to take the date. And so I took her. (Continued on page 2)
the lecture room of Stanley Coulter Hall on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at 11 o’clock. As previously announced, the course will carry three hours credit, and the grades will be determined by Mr. Enders in consultation with Prof. Estey, of the history, economics and government department. Potter Named Head Engineer Committee Dean Potter of the engineering schools, has been named chairman of the committee on engineering schools of the Engineers’ Council for Professional Development, according to a publication recently issued by that body. As chairman of the committee, he will be able to influence greatly the standards required for training in the engineering professions. Dean Potter’s selection has particular importance at this time in view of the rather widespread demands at present to require precollege training before enrolling in an engineering school or by lengthening the engineering course of study to five years or longer.
Lommel Delivers Plea For Local Co-operation “The public official should study the economics of each improvement to see if it is possible to salvage any of the original investment,” stated N. F. Schafer, engineer of maintenance of the State Highway Commission in an address before the Annual Road School general session yesterday morning. The subject of Schafer’s speech was “Salvaging Highway Investments.” Schafer emphasized the fact that through neglect and through lack of visualization, many roads are rebuilt rather than resmfaced. This results in a much larger expenditure than would otherwise be necessary. Relative Road Merits J. G. Schaub, engineer of construction and operations of the Michigan State Highway Department, discussed the relative merits of road-mix and plant-mix bituminous road construction as shown by experiences in Michigan, in the second technical discussion of the morning. C. W. Siniff, of Indianapolis, commissioner of the State Highway Commission, presided over the meeting. Tuesday, Prof. G. E. Lommel, of the University faculty and chairman oi the State Planning Board, delivered a plea that county sur- \ eyors and engineers take an active interest in the planning problems of their communities. “I am firmly convinced that the planning process begins at home. Whenever a group of civic-minded citizens, with capable leadership, discuss and analyze their own problems and formulate their own programs of action, such programs are apt to be more leasonable and possible of achievement than those formulated by an outside agency.” Other Speakers Other speakers at the county surveyors’ and engineers’ session Tuesday included Paul W. Phipps, Madison County; John W. Hildebrand, Marshall Countp; and C. A. Ellis, professor of structural engineering, who prqvided a “short course” in reinforc^ed concrete design. Today the Road School will again be in full swing with separate group meeting in the morning, a general session in the aftetnoon, and the annual banquet in the evening. Gibb Gilchrist, dean of engineering of Texas A&M College, will address the banquet. President E. C. Elliott will act as toastmaster.

By Maeta Kaplan Gas masks, blackouts and mines are merely terms one sees in a newspaper to most of us, but they are very real things to Miss Hed wig Remak, who recently arrived here at Purdue from Germany via England She will enroll in the engineering school the second semes ter Hedwig left Germany m March of 1939 and went to England Dm mg the months between March and December, she attended a commercial school there Pupils were re quired to carry gas masks if they wished to attend classes Everyone was supposed to cany them all the time, but as the threat of attack grew less, fewer people complied with the order I Blackouts were the order of the night Busses traveled with their headlights covered by black paper m which there was a small sht. Traffic signals were covered in much the same manner Pedestnans were allowed to carry dull torches, but they had to be carried down After a time, people’s eyes became accustomed to the dark, and dim outlines could be distinguished For the most part, however, unless there was a moon, nothing could be seen.

Hedwig said It was unwise to go anywhere at night unless you knew your way Side streets and residential sections were the darkest, for the shops were allowed to have half lights In December, Hedwig boarded the boat for America The boat left from Antwerp and traveled in half hour shifts That is the boat would go forward for a half hour and then would stop to make sure all wa^ well During the trip from Antwerp to Southampton passengers were not allowed to undress at night except to take off their shoes Hedwig said that the voyage, it self, was mostly uneventful On De cember 23rd, an SOS was received from a torpedoed Greek ship, and their ship turned to go to assist the disabled vessel But they received another message that the sinking ship had been reached by a British cruiser Half a day was lost, and the sailors were anxious to make up the time so that they could spend Christmas ashore The first glimpse of land was almost indistinguish able from the clouds, but gradually the Statue of Liberty came into view with the Manhatten sky line behind

Arranged By Clevett Vyith the close of the present semester, the intramural department under the direction of “Chief” Clevett, has its program full of plans, so that the Boilermakers can play as well as work. Military Hardwood Krst, and very popular in the coming month of February will be the ever popular military basketball competition between the different batteries of freshmen and aophomores. The league’s teams •mil be formed in February at the afferent battery “Y” hour drills. The athletic officer of each batfery will take the names of each indmdual wishing to participate in military basketball, and if there are too many lads wishing to play in the one military league, Clevett may have to form two different leagues -of military hardwood competition. Military basketball always finishes just before spring vacation, and the winning team members receive a citation, eight merits, and a military medal for championship play. The runner-up teams also receive medals. Each team will play in a round robbin of four games. Play for these games 'will be Febtuary 27-29 and March 6. The finals will be held on March 7. Class “B” Basketball All is in readiness for the start of the class “B” inter-fratemity basketball meet, follo'wing the finals of the class “A” league that will be played the first week of school next semester. Also listed in the near fraternity meets is the coming mterfraternity track and field meet that will be held in the fieldhouse near the end of February.

For the faculty members, there has been announced a combination squash and handball tournament. An all-campus squash tourney is also listed for the near future. Greek Volleyball ^ Just before spring vacation^^ the fraternity volleyball tourney will be held, and the athletic carnival is slated for March 13. A Greek badminton meet will be held before spring vacation, also. Last spring’s beginning golf membership of 76 lads, led “Chief” Clevett to entering the golf lessons on the spring I-M schedule for this

spring, too. Harry Allspaw, pro at the West Lafayette golf club, has been hired to give free golf lessons to students wishing a knowledge of the old Scotch game. The lessons will be given in the golf driving range in the sub basement of the Fieldhouse. The lessons will be given between four and six o’clock each afternoon. Last night. Dr. Miller, student health head, examined 140 agriculture short course members for participation in the approaching short course basketball tourney that will run for five weeks under the direction of Larry Imhoff.
Claims of a precise relation between football records and college enrollment have little if any basis in fact, a recent survey conducted among 10 members of the Western Conference revealed. —fc— Such claims have emanated from critics of the college sport who have contended that enrollment decreases in the college producing a winning football team. The study, comparing total resident enrollment with team ranking for the previous conference football season, shows no basis for a definite correlation between football success and enrollment increase or decrease. —^fc— Results of the study, which was sent to this department by the Big Ten Service Bureau, Chicago, are accompanied by the statement that “There is some reason to believe that even a ■winning team does not catise an increased enrollipent the folio-wing year, good athletics tend to attract some students who are fond of sports.” “On the other hand,” the statement continues, “a university that has no athletics or that sponsors teams that are, year after year, hopelessly outclassed by rival institutions -will probably attract the type of students not interested in sports acti-vities.” —^fc— The accompanying statements add, “It has been pointed out that there are two types of college students; the contemplative, meditative or philosophical type, and the executive type.” “The executive must make decisions quickly, meet changing conditions readily, and apply the results of his knowledge and training. Although some athletes have been great scholars, generally speaking the athlete is of the executive rather than the philosophical type.” —^fc— “Most of our universities that consider their essential function the serving of a democratic society strive to send o'ht into the world both the executive and the philosophical type,” the statement concluded
With the single exception of 1924, Coach Ward Lambert’s Purdue basketball teams have won or shared the Big Ten title in every year since 1920. In addition, the Boilermakers have twice broken their “even year” title stride to figure in the championship distribution in 1921 and 1935. In the 19 years included in the period, the Lambertmen have won or shared in the conference title ten times. —fc— Despite the fact that he played 434 out of a possible 480 minutes in a strenuous eight game schedule last fall, Dave Rankin, Purdue’s AllAmerican end and captain-elect of the 1940 eleven, gained ten pounds during the gridiron season. Rankin started the year tipping the scales at around 180 pounds and ended up jigglihg the bar at around 190 pounds.

Coach Ward Lambert’s Boilermakers hold a top-hea-vy edge in the long-time series ■with their Hoosier foes. In 32 games played with Indiana since Lambert assumed the coaching reins, the Boilermakers enjoy better than a 4 to 1 edge, winning 26 while losing only 6. —fc— Five members of Purdue’s basketball squad have averaged five points or better per game as the Boilermakers have opened their Big Ten campaign with .four straight ■victories.

J Educators Praise Football Oppose Discontinuing It Recently publisbed statemeate by the presidents of Mid-Westezn Universities, evaluating the worth of intercollegiate athletics and assigning a particularly high place to football have directed intezest to the relationship between schohutie attainment and the intercollegiate football program. Frequent criticisms of intercollegiate football have stated that the maintenance of any sport as popular as football results in the scholarship of the student body seeking a lower level, or, that if a University produces inferior football teams, scholastic attainments of the undergraduates will be enhanced. Quitters Came Back Factual evidence to support such conclusions has never been advanced. At different times Universities such as Harvard, Columbia, Northwestern, Stanford and California have discontinued football for a period. Nothing has been shown, however, that the scholarship in those institutions was better during the period in which intercollegiate football was non-existent than it had been previously or at a subsequent time when the football program was restored. Contrary to scientific method, educators who. have boldly asserted that the University producing a poor football team or that has no intercollegiate football thereby improves its scholarship make a categorical statement without submitting evidence on which to base their conclusions. Carnegie Report One of the most significant studies on the subject was that contained in the Report of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, compiled by objective students with a certain lack of bias in favor of athletics. In Bulletin 24 of that report it was stated, “The claim that athletics seriously interfere ■with scholarship apparently remains unproved.” Big Ten Marks Western Conference partisans of the intercollegiate football program point to the fact that while their Conference has been kno^wn as possibly the strongest athletic group m the country, particularly in football, four of its members have been rated as among the first pleven in the country for scholarly eminence by the authoritative ranking of Edwin R. Embree, three others vie for twelfth place in that ranking, and the remaining three each have advanced numerous claims for recognition of their standards. Purdue Teams Are In Finals, But No Lull In Conference Still in low gear as u consequence of scholastic pursuits. Big 3Jen winter sports teams for the most part next week will occupy themselves in non-Conference competi^qn. Five Conference basketball, teams will see action against non-Confer-ence opposition. Iowa meets South Dakota State at home on Monday and Saturday’s bill mcludes Illinois at Notre Dame, Indiana at Del^ul, Wisconsin at Michigan State and Loyola at Chicago. Included on next week’s fare is the opening of the indoor track season, marking the unveiling of a track program which will be climaxed in the late spring by a dual meet between the Pacific Coast Conference and the Big Ten at Evanston, and the National Collegiates at Minneapolis, Track Is Starting ^ T<vo dual meets arc scheduled for Saturday, Carleton meeting Minnesota at Minneapolis and Chicago going to Ohio State. The Millrose A. C. Games in New York Saturday will also attract leading Big Ten figures including Campbell Kane, Indiana sophomore star, and Michigan’s record breaking mile relay team. The Conference hockey program includes return engagement of Michigan Tech with BlinnesoWs powerhouse, at Minneapolis and St. Louis at Illinois.

How's Your Cricket?
Are you a cheater ? And because of that, have you ever turned away from yourself in disgust or writhed in your bed night after night? Probably not, probably not. Most of us cheat in one way or another, but we still like to think we’re honest. We may cheat to change a D to a passing grade, but we leave the property of others alone. Still, if we’d rather cheat than fail. Surely we would rather steal than starve. Our ethics are flavored with expediency. We tolerate dishonesty, else we wouldn’t have it. Even if we don’t cheat, we probably have friends that do. That is, we don’t ostracize the cheat. We don’t have any exact figures on cribbing in this college or in any other. All we know about the cheating that goes on here is what we, learn in open conversation. It isn’t discovered by sneak methods, nobody closes any doors or stops up any keyholes. Well that proves something—^that we attach no stigma to the cheat. We, personally, are neither surprised nor disgusted. We aren’t proud of our attitude, but we do know that if there is safety in numbers it won’t get us into trouble. However, as the English would say, we don’t think cheating is “cricket.” The English have had this little game for about four hundred years. It is rather slow and unexciting. But to them it is a standard. It stands for dignity, fair i)lay, self and mutual respect. It was begun at a time when the morale of the English was low. From its beginning it has remained an un-

touchable—^the essence of the Englishman’s sense of honor and fair play. We think probably that our morale has reached a point similar to that which prompted the English to establish cricket. Sportsmanship, we think, is the blind spot of sophisticated youth. As long as money is the yardstick of success in business, and grades in school, and unless we make playing the game the important thing, there will always be a few who will crib a bit to run up their scores. If pur professors, instead of moralizing or saying nothing, would explain that a D doesn’t mean failure, doesn’t mean we are dumb or a disgrace to our parents, but merely that we haven’t studied, we could say to ourselves, “All right, I haven’t studied so unless I cheat I don’t get a good grade, still I’m sport enough to realize I shouldn’t win unless I’ve tried.” — The Texas State Lass-0.
Hitler declares that the German people prefer cannons to bread. Remembering that bread in Germany today is made from sawdust, we would say that Hitler is probably right.
Before long the signs in Berlin parks' will probably be changed from “Keep Off the Grass” to “Don’t Eat the Grass.”

... The University has at last come into its own: in the way of big name bands that have and are slated to come to the campus. After Tommy Dorsey, we will have Tiny Hill, Boyd Raeburn, Little Jack Little, and Bob Zurke, all bands who are heard regularly on the airlanes.

A new show debuts tonight at 7 p. m. called “Musical Americana.” It will feature “100 men and a tune.” Raymond Paige will conduct the orchestra and the show will be heard on NBC-Blue.

Tonight the “Good News” show will present a radio preview of the movie “Little Old New York,” featuring Alice Faye, Richard Greene, and Brenda Joyce. Alice Faye will sing “Who’s the Beau of the Belle of New York,”
Here is some dope on the band circuit: . . . A1 Donahue’s “Low Down Swing in a Top Hat” will be featured at the President’s Birthday Ball to be held in the WaldorfAstoria on January 30 . . . Bea Wain, victor vocalist, has been named “Vocalist of the Month” by “Swing Magazine.” Shep Fields’ Victorization of “South of the Border” continues as a bestseller in the coin phonograph machines and has resulted in a flock of theater dates . . . Add Ironies: Trombonist Jack Jenney currently is negotiating an extensive and successful theater tour but has yet to see his name spelled correctly on the marquees. It’s invariably —Jenny.

Dear Bull, We believe that since the Student Union is supposed to be for students that it would be a good idea to require that at least one person in each couple going to the Tommy Dorsey dance Wednesday, January 31, present a passport at the door. It would be desirable to keep ballrooms from being overcrowded with townspeople. There will be enough students from the University going to the dance at that price to cover expenses and give us an opportunity to dance rather than just stand around for Want of room to even move.

Raymond Scott fans, plus a brand new army of record collectors, may expect a sensation when Scott’s new band makes a first appearance on Columbia discs about the middle of February. —e-e— Seems as though the trend back to old-timers in songs is getting stronger. There was “Oh, Johnny Oh,” and “Come, Josephine.” Now “Surprised” (1929) has been put on Columbia wax by Orrin Tucker and Bonnie Baker. Bonnie sings in her inimitable style with Tucker holding forth vocally on the reverse side with “Little Girl” . . . Columbia plans a heavy campaign with the discs of tromboner Bradley and the drnmmin’ McKinley. 'The band does its first commercial program for CBS on “Young Man With a Band” January 26. . . .

For those who are planning to carry a light schedule next semester, we would like to go on record as recommending Physical Education 11, which according to the schedule book is two hours of Leisure Time. Ho hum! Something like an advanced course in Physics Lectures ?
By Vladimir An Exponent editorial reprimanded the departments for keeping the names of the instructors for each division from the students. We say amen. But we think a change would benefit some members of the faculty more than it would the students. Captain Wiselogel, for instance.
Whiie we’re at it, we might as well call attention to the modern language department. They are now advertising Beginning Spanish, French, and German (Sec-, ond Semester). Hm-m-m. Slow start. Maybe it’s because of the cold weather—everyone is having trouble starting nowdays.
But we don’t have any trouble stopping. * * Hi
