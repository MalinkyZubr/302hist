Hershey Urges Shirking 4-f's Be Sent To Worii Camps; ^imspn Excuses Anti.Sepiil$ WASHINGTON—A new alphabetical name foi* 4-P’s who refuse to work in essential jobs w^s pro-
on labor draft legislation at a closed-cfpol* rtieeting of the House Military Affairs Committee. r The Pame is MUGS—i. e.,> men unfit for general service. It was pr9ppsed informally tirhile lliershey ^as dpeussing the possibility bf festablishing work
camps for 4-F shiarkera..
“We c^n't handle liis like GGC camps,” the Selective Service boss saiif. “Whep a CpP boy r,efused to live up tq regulations, vye sept him home* th^re should’ be military discipline for the small minority of deferred (f-Fers who are not patriotic enough to work in essential jobs while other young men are fightin^.”' Hershey said that only a hahdful of deferred workers were selfish or unpatriotic enough to refuse
to switch to essential jobs.
“Well, I’m. for singling out these home-front sl@ickens,’^ spofse up Representative Paul Kilday of Texas. “They should he put under military disciplipe and made to wear a distinctive uniform sp evbpy mpther
