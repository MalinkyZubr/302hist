Harriers Oppose Illinois In Season's Initial Race By Paul Miller Beginning what should be one of their most successful seasons,'the Boilermaker Cross Country Team meets the hill and dale team from Illinois here Saturday morning, October 4, at 10:46 a. m. This meet opens the season for both teams and will be run on the new Riveter cross country course. For the most part the three and one-quarter mile run

which begins near the number one tee on the three-hole piactice golf course is covered with glass. The course as, a whole is considered a tough run. From the vieiv-point of the spectators the course is ideally situated because almost the whole tun can easily be seen, mini Sophs Strong As the Boilermakeis didn’t meet the mini last year, little is known of their relative strength However, they did have one of the strongest frosh cross country teams in the Big Ten last season. It is very probable that the Illini have several veiy piomising sophomores among then six-man team, because they seem unusually anxious to meet the Boileimakers. Captain Ed Holderman and “Woody” Appleton tied on the fiist time trial over oui new couise with 15.42 minutes for the three and one-quarter miles. And this remains as the course record until it is broken. Riveters In Good Shape Don Kemp and Norman Roach showed excellent form in the running of the time trial. And with the exception of Charles Duesler, who pinched a nerve in his left foot m Thursday’s practice, the team is in excellent condition for their first
meet, p.g.m.

Greek Bowlers Enter Winter Season Round Under PMUDiredion As last year’s Bowling Tournament gained widespread popularity, the Student Union is again si^misobing an Interfraternity Bowlnlg League. Eds and Co-eds alike enjoy this spoit and no particular skill is needed to enter. Many leagues have been started by the different departments of the University. Through the winter months, bowling is especially popular. Both young and olc%^ there, pitting their skill against the
pins.
Five Man Teams The league this year will run on the same basis as last year’s except the aspirants will be teams instead of individuals as before. A team will consist of five members who, with another team of five, will bowl alternately on two alleys. The teams themselves will do the scoring and the total score of the team members will constitute the game score for their respective team. At the end of nine weeks, the four finalists will be the two teams having won the most games in each of the two brackets. In order to make this tournament a success and fair to all participants the following rules will be enforced: 1. Only those whose names appear on the official entry blank will be allowed to paiticipate. 2. The teams scheduled to bowl, in accordance with the schedule appearing in the Exponent, must appear at the scheduled time. 3. Each team will bowl three games a night at a cost of $2 50 per team. This is 15 cents per game per man plus five cents per man to be used to buy the trophies. 4. Failure to follow the above rules will be cause for forfeit The Vice Piesident in charge will have complete control of the touinainont and any questions arising will be settled by him.
• Derbies Keep Sun Off AH Afternoon There was no joy in the Derby section yesterday afternoon! Hopeful seniors nervously fingered their badge of distinction after four years of hard work for four quarters, each telling the others the Boilermaker machine would begin to click any mi,putc. The 1942 class has lost something that can never be regained. Second hand derbies are a dime a dozen today. • What Happened? Why didn’t the Boilermaker machine begin to click? It was a fequad of veterans ably supported by anxious gophomoie material. Certainly Vanderbilt has been practicing since the middle of the past month to gain mid-season perfection. We have no doubt that the Vanderbilt team was rough, and that the officials might have been loath to see this roughness. But these excuses don’t seem to give the answer. • Something New Has Not Been Added This Boilermaker squad has a lot of the something that it takes to make a good ball club, experience, competition for positions, ability to take coaching, speed (at least we thought so) reserve material, and several other favorable points. But it just seemed like they needed a stick of dynamite to explode in the huddle to set off a spaik that would bring this potentiality to light. It seemed like the squad was somewhat muddled, lacking coordination if
you will.
• Plenty To Look Forward To We still have a great team in this gang that lost the opener yesterday. Seven big games are still on the schedule. Only one major injury, a broken rib by Bob Kersey, was sustained in yesterday’s fracas. As far as we’re concerned yesterday’s game is a closed book. It happens to the best of teams, losing these openers. Don’t pass judgment on the 1941 squad until these seven games have been played. • This 3-0 Stuff Is Getting To Be A Habit 3-0 scores in Boilermaker season openers are getting to be thicker than Nazi spies. Remember that same score licking two years ago at Notre Dame on a field goal by a fourth string quarterback from an angle that was so wide he practically had to kick a curve ?
DeGarmo Announces Yell Leaders For Grid Season Yesterday afternoon the Riveter fans saw some action, not only the 1942 edition of the Boilermaker football squad, but also the fine crop of yell leaders who have been practicing on the soft turf of RossAde Stadium for the past two
weeks.
Nearly fifteen freshmen fellows and girls have been trying out for places on the squad in addition to those_ sophomores and juniors who were selected last year. Head cheer leader Dick DeGarmo and Johnny Goll, manager, have chosen the following to lead yells for the remainder of the Reason: Bob Stone and Bruce Adams, juniors; Pete Schwab, sophomore; Ed Gruis and Dick Miller, freshmen; Jean Barrett, sophomor^; Silvia j^olites, and Billie Nichols, freshmen. In piactice the tumbling of Jean Barrett and the freshmen fellows have been outstanding. Bob Stone has been performing on the “strong man” part of the tumbling acts in fine fashion. This year DeGarmo has devi
Frosh Basketballers^ End First Week's Drill After a week of stremipus scrimmage sessions, nearly 126 freshmen basketball players have been given an equal opportunity to show Coach “Piggy” Lambert just how tough they are. Practice will continue for the entire squad for about two weeks at which time Lambert will cut fifty men from the roster.
Many Schoolboy Stars
The greater majority of the fellows have seen considerable action on the hardwood courts of their respective high schools; a few have even attained all conference and allstate ratings. Several, however, have never played before but may develop in time to make the squad. “Piggy” has watched and will continue to watch the scrimmages each

Information Please
The scouts try to get as much information about the other teams as IS possible in the limited time which they have. Whenever possible, the same man scouts the same team all season, thus getting quite well acquainted with the style of the particular team to which he
is assigned.

Walter Cook By Dave Shryer Fiom the mountain plateaus of Wyoming comes one of the sturdiest halfbacks on the Boileimakei squad. Walter Cook came to Puidue in 1939 to become an important cog in the Riveter football machine. Walt hails from the town of Caspar where he was a three spoit man. An all-state quarter back for two years, he also starred in basketball and track. Now operating from the left halfback post, he also plays shortstop and thud base on the Riveter baseball team. Last year Walt played right halfback, but he was switched to left half during the many backfield changes made by Coach Mai Elward this season. Likes AH Sports - Walt IS a junior ;n the school of Physical Educatioh, and he is a member of Delta Upsilon social fi ateinity. He declares that he has no special hobbies aside fiom athletics which occupy a major portion of his time. Getting around the country is nothing new to tfiis -little giant of the gridiron. Aside from making his home in the far west and attending school in Indiana, he has a pm girl in Tulsa, Oklahoma from whom he receives at least two letters a week His favorite amusemerits include danciiig to sweet music as played by Glenn Miller. Revives Drop Kick ( In addition to his fine woik on offense and defense, Walt is the most accomplished diop-kickeis on the Riveter squad. In the future fans may expect to see many conversion attempts made by this seldom used but very effective method.
