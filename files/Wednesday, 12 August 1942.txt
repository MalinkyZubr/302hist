Requests For Rides Outpumbe^ In its first .day of activity yesterday, the Student Union’s new travel bureau, established in co-operation with the National Office of Defense Transportation, received eight requests for transportation to several cities in Indiana, Battle Creek, Michigan, and as far west as Denver, Colorado. As yet, only one driver has submitted his name. Eliminates Waste The purpose of the travel bureau is to eliminate as much waste as possible in tires and gasoline by having all student cars go home for the vacation wilh'a full load. The bureau replaces the bulletin board in the library, but will be in effect only for vacation periods. A double file system is being used, one file for drivers, and one file for those wishing rides. Arrangements for the allocation of passengers will be made by Union workers, and students will be notified as soon as a ride is available. Urge Students To Register Union workers want to urge students to register with the bureau as soon as possible in order to provide as many rides as possible. Principal shortage at the present exists in registration of available
car space.

Chdrt AMs War Stamp Sales Lambda Chis Lead Drive A definite upswing in War Stamp sales has been in evidence, according to Student Union officials who are conducting the drive, since the installation of a chart in front of the Sweet Shop showing the per capita donations of all houses on the campus. Dismayed by the failure of getting student co-operation in the stamp selling campaign, the Union has resorted to the chart, attempting to instill a spirit of competition in to the sales. Chart Shows Purchases The new chart lists all fraternities, soroiities, co-op houses and other organized groups. After each name there appears a horizontal red line, indicating the avera.ge purchases per person from the house. Results will be posted from day to
day.
Up until four-thiry yesterday afternoon, the Dover House, men’s coop, held the lead by a wide margin, with an average of $2.60 worth of stamps for each man. Later, however, a representative of Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity purchased $68 worth of twenty-five cent stamps, bringing the Lambda Chi’s record to $2.50 per man.

Student Leaders Spend AAonth Studying Democratic Struggle
“I learned more at Campobello in one month than m a year at college.” “The most concentrated single expellence of my life.” With these words summing up their impressions of a month’s strenuous study and activity on the all-important topic of a “Democratic Strategy for War and Peace,” fifty-seven student leaders headed home this week from the two Summer Student Training Institutes sponsoied by International Student Seivice at Campobello, New Brunswick and Asheville, North Carolina. Sjtudy |Pive WeeJks I^’ tb.e shofj; span of five weeks thq students had engaged ip folepsic free-for-alls with speakers ranging from Mrs. Roosevelt to Ch^inese Ambpssai^or Hu S^il?, they had been submerged in a veritable Hopd of lectures op politics, economics, military strategy, they had sat i^p fai into the night in sober and pj;'ovocative discussion on how to make the colleges more effective participants in the struggle for democratic survival. ’■ atud?pts from all parts
of the country—from the scraggly shoies of Maine straight across the continent to the blue Pacific. The fifty-seven lucky ones were picked from a lis,t of 60^0 applicanj:s. All of tbem were leaders o;^ student activity—editors of college newspapers, heads of Student Councils, presidents of local YM and YWCA’s, chairman of college defense committees. Stayed At Summer Homes Living and studying for a month far from the centers of urban distraction, they were able to plug more intensively at the sizable agenda before them. Twenty-seven of the students ^vere housed at the two Roosevelt summer homes on Campobello Island, New Brunswick, jusit oft' the coast of Maine. Sturdy, spacious clapboaid structures, painted bright red for protection against the ravages of the weather, one of the houses was built by the President for his own use and the other formerly belonged to his mother, the late Mrs. James Roosevelt. The students lived in the Piesident’s home and the staff of the Institute and the visiting lecturers
lived in his mother’s house. The Institute members heard lectures and held discussion meetings in the large living room of the President’s house, overlooking the bay. Studying at night, they burned the wick of a half dozen oil lamps—^no electricify on the island. For recreation, they wept sailing in the President’s own boat, built for him when he was a boy. They held a concert for the fisherfolk of the Island, playe4 the “toiynies” in a baseball tournament and were soundly trouncei^, bounded around on the tennis court and went swimming iP the chilly lyaters of the Bay of Fundy.

National Committees of ISS survive only in China, Great l^ritain, Canada, New Zealand, Switzerland, and the United States. In Germany, Italy and in the countries dominated by the Axis, its work has 'been suppressed, its secretaries imprisoned and one executed, ‘ '
The United States Committee of the International Student Service has retained the emphasis on international problems and on student relief. At the same time, the United States Committee has extended its program in t^iis country and is devoting it^ main efforts towards aiding students to prepare themselves for effective citizenship in this country and in an interdependent woild. Through' regional and national conferences, works camps and summer training institutes, students have learned to understand the basic ideas that have shaped this democracy and have become familiar with the background and meaning of this war. A studept magazine, “Threshold,’* provides students with a means of expressing their views on political, social and economic issues, while the "Washington Student Service bureau'assists them in undersWnding the functions of ®mocratic government. In these ways the United States Committee is helping American young people to ^ssume their responsibility in winning th& way and “the peace of interdependeneq,” for whiolr we are now fighting.

Travel Bureau . ..
The deluge of tests that the end of the senicstcr has caused probably holds first place in the interest of most students right now but thoughts and plans for vacation run a close second. I he transportation problem home used to. bo .solved for those of us that lived over a hundred miles away by the Student Senate’s special trains. And for those that live closer by hitch-hiking. The .special trains died with the war and with the decreased automobile pleasure driving hitch-hiking is nearly a lost art. All of which leads us to the Student Union Travel Bureau. In years past the only way that peo]jIe who were driving home had to contact people who wanted rides was on the bulletin board in the library. For this vacation the Travel Bureau is supplementing this by registering all those who have cars and plan to drive and all those who want a ride and then matching the two groups so that all cars are filled. The registration is being conducted every afternoon from 4 to 5:30 in the Great Hall of the Union. The motto of the Travel Bureau, “every car a full car”, fits in with the government-’^ con.servation program and with the recent reque.'^t of Bresident Elliott to conserve tires and cars. The Bureau can be a really worthwhile contribution to conservation if all vacationing students cooperate.

Editor’s Note: The Exponent offers this column to its readers for an expression of their views on local, national or international questions which are pertinent. They are printed exactly as written. Editor, Purdue Exponent Memorial Union Building West Lafayette, Indiana Some two thousand years ago the Roman imperialists made a martyr of one of the world’s most revolutionary thinkers, Jesus Christ, who preached the brotherhood of man, the equality of all people, and the substitution of co-operation and good will for war and hate. Sunday morning the British imperialists took the first step towards making a martyr of Mahatma Ghandi, who, besides preaching the brotherhood of man and the fruitlessness of war, also has been trying to secure independence for the hundreds of millions of Indian people. In 1812 the United Kingdom was fighting the armies and navies of Napoleonic France, in what has since been compared to the present war as one for national survival and continued independence. In that same year, 1812, the United States of America went to war with the Britsh to preser-^American independence and freedom of the seas. Let us draw a parallel. • British Molestation In 1812 For some ten yeais before the War of 1812, the American government had protested to the Biitish about maritime molestation and the thi’eat to our national independence, and each protest the English statesmen answered with polite assurances that steps would be taken Wend the unpleasant situation. However, the American merchant ships continued to be stopped and boaided by boats of the Royal Navy, and in 1812 a war lesulted that settled the issue. For some twenty years now, the Indian people have sought independence from their Biitish rulers. For twenty yeais the Downing Street diplomats have put independence or dominion status off. Not once has the question been put up to a vote before the people of Gieat Britain and of India, because the ruling class lealises that such a lefeiendum would indicate the majority belief in Indian independence, and thus provide moie fuel for its partisans. In 1921 and in 1930 Mahatma Ghandi led his people in non-violent civil disobedience campaigns to seek the end of British exploitation, taxation, and domination. Since the start of this war, the All-India Congress has asked, and then demanded, independence foi the nation. Always, the answer has amounted to “Not now; later.’’ Just how long are the United Nations going to defer democracy, for which they ostensibly are fighting? Does it not seem logical that the eneigies of four bundled million people, when once devoted to the mihtaiy defeat of the fascist powers, can likely provide the telling blow to the common enemy, the Nazi-Fascist-Nipponese aggressois? And does it not seem sensible that the Indian people, having known generation after geneiation of British despocy and exploitation and mis-rule and promise, should mistiust that nation’s piesent promise of postwar independence ? Lin Yutang, the great Chinese wiiter, states the case for Indian independence as follows: “India wants hei freedom; she is united in wanting that fieedom; she is qualified by hf*r splendid leadership to have that freedom immediately; she has pledged to use that fieedom, not foi a deciease, but for an increase, in her share of lesponsibility to fight the Axis^poweis.” i • India May Turn To Japan The chief objections to present Indian independence are that an immediate granting of it would result in negotiation with Japan, in an inteinal chaos, and in a severe lestriction on the Allied military defence of India. Let Ghandi answer the first charge: “If India became an independent nation tomorrow I would certainly advise and plead with the provisional government to send me to Japan. I would plead with her in the first instance to free Cliiiia”, after which, if refused, he added, he would tell Japan it would have to count on India’s stubborn resistance. Again: “I can give no assurance (not to negotiate) because if I deal with Japan and if I am allowed to do so by the Free India Government I would do so purely in the interest of the Allied cause. It may be the efl'ort and optimism of a visionary, but it can do no harm to the war efloit. It will discredit” Japan if a fiiendly gesture on behalf of gioaning humanity is repelled.” As far as an internal condition of chaos goes ,the Moslems and the Hindus have in the past co-operated impiessively, and the lecent signs of dissention aie quite obviously Biitish-inspired. The Indian people are united, and their leadership is more lepresentative and more obviously competent than ouis is. What little inteinal violence would result would be insignificant when compaied to what will probably result from the present general strike. Nehru, second only to Ghandi in the re.spect of the Indian people, said: “Ghandi . . . was detirmined to resist every aggressor in India, and advised our people to do so, even to the point of death. They were never to submit. It is absurd to say that any of us envisaged any arrangement with Japan . . . India is in imminent danger of aggression, and the dangei cannot be faced without full fieedom. We want fiedom for prejraration to meet the gieater struggle for human existence.” In the Sunday Exponent, an editoiial “Passive Treachery” appeared, to which this is in part an answer. That editorial ends with the statement; “The only difference between Ghandi and any quisling in Europe is th^t he has absolute control over a great many more people.” True, he is the leader of the Indians, but his leadeiship is deseived, intelligent, competent, and not absolute. As to the compaiison between Ghandi and the quislings, such a statement is adolescent in expression, unintelligent in light of the tiue facts, and utteily naive of any clear, logical analysis of Ghandi and his movement.

In its relontlos.s elf011 to tie all loose ends in the Indiana war pioduction effoit, the War Pioduction Boaid this week launched a drive to discover and tabulate idle houis on ciitical machine tools. Of the 900 faetoiies which have listed their facilities with the Indiana Distiict Office of the WPB, 400 have machine tools designated by the WPB as critical, Fiank Hoke, district manager, stated. Will Visit 400 Factories These 400 faetoiies will be visited during the diivc, and the idle time dining which they could be used for uork outside of that for which the facLoiy holds contiacts will be listed, ho said. “The usefulness of such records is apparent, and it has been proved this caily in the survey,” TJi. Hoke said. “In the fiist 23 faetoiies to bo suiveyed, it was found that thcie was a total of about 12,000 idle machine hours per week available on ciitical machines, some of which subsequently have been used. 51 Critical 'Pools “The government lists 54 machine tools on the ciitical list, and a good many of these can be found in Indiana machine shoiis. Obviously, if we know when these machines can bo used for outside woik, and if we ihen find that theio is out■^ido woik needing to be done on them, we can put the two together. Without such a sinvey, it would be all but impossiiilo to thus smoothly get machine and woik togethei. It will be a gicat tune-saver.”

The Gimlets and the Reamers will have at each other in a game of softball tonight at etSfi on diamond 2 on Intramural Field. The game, first in a long series of annual conflicts on the diamond between the two organizations, will go 7 innings, unless someone loses the bajl, or darkness interferes.' The season records of both of the opposing teams are clean. Neither has lost or been tied. Neither has won any games, either. In fact, members of both squads are playing together for the first time. The results should be astounding. , It is rumored that more than prestige hangs upon the outcoM^e of' the contest, and fierce contesting of every score and umpire’s decision is anticipated. On the eve of the contest, neither manager carfed to make any statements pertaining to the game. In fact there was sopie dpUbt as to who they were. ^ j The lineups of the two teams, as they will appear, follO'ws: GIMLETS RfAlilteRS Irwin, 3b StiggleK^li, 2b Snyder, sf Ginder, ss Lodge, ss Emerson, lb Warren, lb Leifheit, 3b Shimer, 2b Bennett^'c Hadley, c Williamson, sf Farnsworth, If Wiley, rf Smerke, cf Kashner, cf Epsing, rf Utley, If O’Bryan, p Wolter, p All members of both clubs are urged to be in attendance at the game in order to properly influence the umpires’ decisions. The new crop of posters advertising the Boilermaker grid schedule is appearing all over the state these days, as are posters from practically every other school in the country. Some |tardy soul even put a cream and crimson placard, calling attention to the games being played this fall by a downstate college located at Bloomington, in a Lafayette store window.

Mackey Meets Henricksen In Golf Finals Guy Mackey, Boilermaker athletic director, and Don Henricksen will battle it out for the All-Campus Golf Cl own. Mackey entered the finals by triumphing 4 and 3 over Bob Stackhouse last night, and Henricksen, a senior in chenjical engineering, gained his berth in the, final round by outshooting H. T. Harrison, junior engineer. Henricksen and Harrison overcame Ted Shead and Jack Kahler, respectively, to win their way into the semi-
finals.
Stackhouse State Runner-Up Stackhouse, recent runner-up in the Indiana State Junior Golf Tournament, attained the semi-finals by beating Sam Voinoff. Mackey won from Rogers Schutt to get his spot m the next-to-last round. Henricksen and Mackey are to tee off sometime before August 16. In the “A” flight there have been three quarter-final matches played since the last leport on the progress of the tourney. In these struggles, Larry LaBree was defeated by Jim Stiggleman, “Dutch’,’ Fehring outsticked football mentor Elmei Burnham, and Joe Inman ended up with fewer strokes than M. L. Clevett. Fehring vs. Inman As yet, only one semi-final match has been run off in this flight and it involved Phil Connelly and Stiggleman. The latter came out on top and, as a result, entered the final round. The remaining semi-final match between Fehring and Inman is to be played in the near future. In the “B” flight there remains one quarter-final match to be played before the semi-final bracket will be complete. This encounter will feature W. France and Joe Simons. The remaining semi-final berths were filled last week by Ed Wells,

R. Meyers, and Floyd Eastwood. Wells and Meyers reached their spots in the semis via the default route, whereas Eastwood was forced to win his place. He did this by outstroking Rumble in a quarterfinal engagement. Thus, Eastwood will meet Myers in the lower bracket semi-final match and Wells is paired against the winner of the Fran^e-Simons match in the upper bracket.
Riveter Football Stars Look Ahead To Armed Service Football and preparation for active participation in the war effort will-be closely allied as far as the bulk of the members of Elmer Burnham’s gridiron squad are concerned
this fall.
The gridiron game will not be the only combat for which the Boilermakers will be in active training. Locker room conversation this fall is apt to be as much concerned with the progress of training to enter the nation’s armed forces as with plans for each succeeding game on the ambitious schedule of ten major op-
ponents.
Fourteen Already Signed An incomplete survey of the 43 candidates who are expected to compose Coach Burnham’s varsity squad this fall indicates that 14 members have already definitely enlisted in the Army, Navy, or Marine Corps Reserve and will trade their diplomas for uniforms immediately following conclusion of their University training, which has been geared to fit war needs. To Join Other Lettermen Many others, including most of the 11 men on the squad who are under the 20 year combat age limit according to present selective service laws, are now in the process of completing enlistments, in order to make sure that they will be able to take their places alongside the over 200 Purdue major lettermen who are now in active service in virtually all parts of the world. Many of the gridders, notably those majoring in such subjects as engineering, have been continuing their attendance at the University during the summer term in order to speed the day when they complete their training and can make their specialized knowledge available to the armed forces or war industries. Stuhldreher Will Use Rockne System Madison, Wis., Aug. 11—“Our basic attack will still be closely related to style devdoped by Knute Rockne, as it has been in the past; but we shall attempt to modify it so that it will best mold itself to the individual abilities which we will have on our squad this fall.” This will be the basic theme on which the 1942 University of Wisconsin football machine will operate this fall, according to Head Coach Harry Stuhldreher. Follows Rockne Closely Stuhldreher probably follows the teaching of Rockne more closely than any of the pupils of the famous Irish mentor and is expected to continue to do so this fall. The Badgers wtll again start from a “T” formation and shift to a box formation when they do shift. However', in line with many other squads throughout the nation, they probably will run more plays from the “T” this fall than ever before. Evidence of this trend comes in the fact that Stuhldreher in spring practice decided to abandon the arm wave during the shift into the box formation. This has been an identifying characteristic of the Badgerelevens since the arrival in Madison of the former member of the Four Horsemen. Build Around Harder The Badger's are again expected to have power-ful running attack built around fullback Pat Harder, who as a sophomore in 1941 was the Big Ten’s leading ground gainer and scorer. Stuhldreher has been fortunate since coming to Camp

In one of the “battles of the century” the Tau Kappa Epsilon softball team eked out a 1 to 0 victory over the Phi Kappa Taus to win the fraternity softball crown for this summer semester, on Intramural Field last night. The game, which started at 6:30 p. m., lasted but an hour as both sides went down quickly under the barrages of Bob Hodapp and Bob Hajzyk, the Phi Taus and

Another interesting play was an error by catcher Paul Neuhauser, in which he accidentally hit the bat of Teke Rodger Spaulding, when the latter connected with the ball. Spaulding flew out to the second baseman, but the umpires ruled that he be given first since the catcher hit the bat. ^ Osterling Sparks Play Probably the most exciting play of the game was a beautiful assist by Bud Osterling from his position in short center field. Bud threw out A1 Chun as he was running down to first base on what everyone on the field throught was a sure hit."^ Osterling threw a low pass to Larry Thrasher to put the man out from
