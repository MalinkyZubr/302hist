Cody, Riveter fullback, ' Wmit* tbfe hbnors for outstanding 'j'.'>1. I play for the Boil-
ermakers, as he was the only back who consistently gained on line plunges, or on any play involving the line. Boris Dimancheff was the scorer for the Riveters oin a 5, perfectly exe-
OODY cuted pass play, ti^ng the hall on the Seahawk 40 bp a pass from the Purdue 34, and racing the 40 yards to a touch-
’^O'wn.
i^ine Starts Slow
^ The game opened with the Riveter* receiving. After three plays r^agginst an pnyielding line, the Riveters were forced to kick and that wap the type of play the first quarter yielded, with both sides being ^orce^ to kick. Mertes made sev'eral first downs and had the ball f m" bn the 20, where the Sea7k8 decided to try a field goal, fScbleicb’s kick was no good,
l^iveters taking over.
S^rwt started earlyy in the sec- ■“ quarter, as the Seahawks Starie!^ fumbling. Morton recovon the Purdue 34 and two ^Jayp later the Riveters scored on |the puss play to Dimancheff.
