Geriainiy not the students, With the studeht ;:ieili?|p|ie^£eyer.;<^;^ ii^rease,^ :it'' is- 'hi^ th^d that the system of ticket sales for these '.shows be changed to give Purdue students the'first opportunity. . • The ptesent system of handling ticket salei *1^ set up for the time when the whde stui^ debt body and faculty could not half fill; the ^i^ic HM. It was then necessary to depend heatdly upon townspeople to haake the Varie: ties successful financially. Under those eonditiodls there was little problem in getting seats pn patt ot any student. UdEet sales as handled now throw the best seats op^ to all mail orders for several weeks in advance of the over-the-counter sales. lu^uns that students must compete against townspeople for the choice seats: Since many students do not learn of coming events right away, and many other students are more inclined to buy direct than by mailing an order to an office they pass frequently, whjaf happens is that the majority of good seats are gone ijefore most of the students buy their tickets. We are speaking espeeiaUy of the coming Victor Borge show.

SenaMr Overton's Office Help SdUatpr John Overton of Lduisiapa is a mighty liberal man when it comes to paying his staff, especially W'hen they happen to be relatives. For some years both his daughters, Eatherine and Ruth, were on the congressional payroll. Katherine got married and no longer sups at the public trough, but Ruth Overtoh still receives more than $2,200 a year. Senator Overton is also pretty liberal about time off for his help, especially when they .are kinfolk. Recently Ruth had an enjoyable yacatidn in Cuba.
