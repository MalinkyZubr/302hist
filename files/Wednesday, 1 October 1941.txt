Herby Hoover called it “a noble experiliaejit,” a,nd then in his customary manner proceeded to do nothing about that ghastly hypocrisy called Prohibition. Instituted by a huge collection, of femalh busybodies, prohibit^oii was noble neither in intent not effect. ^ Unfortunately it seems that the University Is in somewhat the same rut that engulf ed Herby. The University also has prohibition-— in^case you didn’t know it. And Purdue pro* hi^i,tion doesn’t work either, nor does the University intend that-it shall work. The Unk versity code makes this interesting statement; “The use of intoxicating liquors ... shall’be regarded as good cause^kor the ex^ dasioit of; a, student from thn University.” Only silly persons like ourselves ever bother about-things like this, and since within the ipemory of any six-year^ student thore has been no effort to enforce this rule in spite, of _the fact that violation is nearly universal, I'some wohld say that there is no. point in poking the old fossil around. But there is. Being young we have always had the. idealistic, opinion that,laws are made for a purpose and unless they are meant to be enforced they should not exist. It seems to us that this is but an example of. that not too pleasant Am-, erican custom of being utterly insincere for the sake of curious moral ideas that should have been exterminated with the basement
rats long before our era. These moral hypocrisies seem to be perpetuated by old ladies and fogey churchmen who take advantage of that other quaint American obsession: violent opposition to throwing anything away no matter how useless or actually-harmful. And i we think .this rule is harmful feecaiise,^it i teaches, a disregard,; for, luwfi ■v^h^n.tke.j.tihiversity maintains a part of the code merely for assatiating cranks and then, winks. at its violation.; > , < \^e.;have no desire to be misunderstood: we are not condoning drinking, and we are, not asking for enforcement of the rule prohibiting it amo,ng-,students; we are asking thatitk® rule n,ot be kept in-the code,an,dane,%K,kW<^^ to be honest-for once., We ^nT-knpyf Ayhat percentage of the. stiident body drinks, and furthermore we don’t care.

(Reprinted from The Dartmouth) Now we been waitin’ -long enough! Our Bums clinched it yesterday afternoon and dere’s joy down by the old Gowanus tonight. Why, say, we knew the bums could do it- all along. Whatdye mean, wait till next year? We been waitin’ long enough.. Why we desoiye it. It took us 21 years to do it and dull bums desoive it. We won duh last one im 1920 and that’s a long time ago. We’ve had some good bums playin’ fer us since then but it took the Lip to put the old flag back where it belongs in-Ebbetts Field. We never get no breaks until dis season. Yeah, we desoive it. . Jees, how about the way that' kid Reiser’s been socking the ball? And how about Ducky' Medwick out dere in duh field? Dixie Walker, too. No kiddin’, what a relief, after dose bums we used to have out dere. Guys like Hoiman, Eckardt, Winsett, and Manush. Especially Hoiman. There was a bum! We wuz tellin’ some guys, at the field last week about how de Babe slid into tlioid with two bums already dere. And about the time we seen him sock a home run with two on and den pass Del Bissonette on the way home. Sure, he wuz out. The bum! Yeah, it’s a relief to see some guys who can handle the ball like somethin’ besides a drunk at the Montague after a close game. Reese and Billy Hoiman make a svreet combine. And de guys have got vinegar -—that’s what counts, too—vinegar. Oh jees. Our Bums are swell guys. Last mont’ a drunk walks into a Brooklyn hotel in de evening. He walks up to a magazine salesman behind, a counter and says: “What did the bums do today?” Before he could get an answer a young guy playin’ pool looks up and ,says: “We win.” It was Koiby Higbe! Jees, what a swell gu5''!
Yeah, we knew dey could dp it. But we wuzn’t coitain until Red Barber called the last Brave opt yesterday and, then said that the Cards had lost. Dem Cards wuz plenty tough this year. Dey had a: swell team anct wuz good guys. But we won duh pennant. We-desoiyed it and we eiped it. We ,remembuh when dem Cards gypped, us in 1931. We had the pennant in the bag. wit’ only seven games to go. Den dem Cards epine.to Ebbetts Field and wiri" free straight and we wiml up fourth! We didn’t (iesoive that, did .we? Duh, Cards even beat Dazzy Vance in that series, Jees, there, was a, swell bujn! He woiked hard and we bet he’d, like to be pitching against dem Yanks in the series. Jees, we cquld use him. . ' The only player we got now that Uncle Robbie brought up is Hughie Casey. Robbie wuz a good guy and he’d like, to be here today to know that he helped a little in winnin’ dis one for the Brooks. Robbie got seme tough breaks but he’ll be watching this series from somewhere. Yeah, now we gotta worry about dem Yanks.' Dey ain’t so tough. Course we only seen ’em play once when our bums wuz out of town. But dey ain’t so tough. We seen Wyatt pitch good enough to beat ’em and we got faith in big Dolf to hit a couple, Jees, remember duh one he socked into centerfield to beat duh'.Cubs a couple of mont’s ago? What a sock! Jees, what a guy! We ain’t never been woild champs. Jees, it’d be nice to be woild champs. Just fink of Our Bums as 'Woild Champs! Maybe Lippy’Il get it for us. We desoive it. Jees, it’d be nice to be woild champs!' Come on Whitlow! Come on PeeWee! Come, on Koiby! Come on Bums!

After a week-end such as this last one there,.should be quite a fewincidents and such ;^orthy of note, so let’s see just what did go on around this “dull, dry, un-Joey” school of our’n. First,, there was the Alpha Chi , initiation and the celebration that followed. Every place you turned around there was one of the “Horizontal” Alpha Chis keeping things lively and we mean lively. Oh. well, initiation.s are good excuses fog such goings on. Then there was the carload of seniors who tuined the tables on the rhinies by driving up, luring an unsuspecting fre.shman to the car, then .swiping his pot and driving off—leaving a bewildered and
tearful little man behind. Those big bad seniors. Tsk. Tsk. The KAPPAS came into their own at the game Saturday by taking over the senior section in a big way. Jan Yeoman would leave every five minutes to get a coke while her sisters kept the game going. Never knew there were so many seniors over at the Kappa house. Other stadium sights were: Margie Seibert back initown; (Now you know why Sonny” Cherrington. was all smiles in spite of the loss of his soup-strainer.) Pe'g Davis in the first row looking plenty sharp; the Theta Taus’ heavily decorated cords; lots of cigar-sick (or otherwise) seniors; the stupified frosh awed by all the commotion; and; uh, the football teairi. Vern Ho.ssellman of the Beta tribe has moved across the street from the Chi 0 house to the Kappa clubhouse. Since breaking up with I)ottie McLain he has been courting the Kappas’ pride and joy (Dave Rankin’s ditto)—Dottie Canfield. Joe Rayniak blew into town, Friday end swept the 'campus as far as dqtes go. Friday night found
him in Indianapolis with ex-Purdue queen Erma Bejrry. Saturday, night was spent with, a brother’s pin girl. Sunday at nine he had breakfast with Annie (Cleopatra) Ostrander. Sunday at ten-thirty our gal Peg D.avis furnished the enters tainment. Nothing like getting around,.is there? Come back again soon Joe. I think there are a few you missed. .

Dutton will cause a gi’egt deal of worry to opposing teams should he ever find an opening for he is one of the best open field runners Pitt has on its squad. Connell, a converted fullback, is a triple threat back for he kicks, passes, and runs with the best of them. Walter West, junior quarterback, will be starting his second year as a varsity man.

My second suggestion is thkt we follow the team into every game; get out and visit the practice field on Monday; organize excursions and round trips to all the games away from home; see the team off—T,000 strong—to these games awqy from home; post placards around the campus with PEP booster slogans on them; make every pep session a really big, important affair with everyone in attendance; and finally, get around and meet the other gay who, perhaps, feels the same loyalty you have for your University and
your teani,
It’s up to the student body. We owe it to ourselves and to our college days to nuiture all the school, spirit we can plant. Let's not see any Chicago University “de-emphasia”^ of football on the Boilermaker cam-
pus.
Sincerely, D. T. B. ’4».■

Panting pianos, good gosh, holy mackerel and all that stuff; Did we find something hot ? Man these records .sizzle. We’re speaking Q:(',,some more of that old barrel-house, back beat, boogie woogie. You not-so-lily-white Chicagoans may have heard the fellow that does the piano pounding; he plays at the, Capitol Bar and his name is Maurice Rocco. That fellow must have three or four hands and at least a couple of pianos to put out stuff like he does. He has made several records and they are all just as solid as is posStars And Burs— DonH Mix "^Em Up

sible to be had from something as hollow as a piano. Among the better disks are “Rocco’s Boogie Woogie,” “Tonkey Blues,” “Jungle Drums,” and “Rocco’s Blues.” The first one, in our opinion, tops every eight-beat rhythm ever made. ■Just listening to this old boy covering the 88 makes your left arm tired all the way down to your hips. If the paper would let us, vve’d print Rocco’s name in capitals all over ;the place, because he really deserves it. Yancey and Meade Lux were good, but this man Rocco leads them both by about three or four lengths. Please let us say it again —Man, but this guy Rocco is good!! Now if we can cool down a little, we’d like to give you a lead on something new by the Ink Spots. They’ve gotten away from their “If I didn’t Care” touch on this one and have got down to some good ol.’ jiverie. Evidently those four boys never beard of our beloved physician, because they keep shouting “Hey
Doc.”
Deke takes hold of the middle chorus and pulls it right out of the rest-—roots and ^11. “Hey Doc” is certainly one of their best,- and incidently, “I Don’t Want To Set The World on,Fire” backs it up.
“Flamingo” Recorded
Duke Ellington recorded a short time ago a number that has been trying to ,get on top, but just hasn’t been able to gather enough; it deserves a boost and if we can. help we’ll do it. The number is “Flamingo” and after you’ve heard the record the name will mean something to you. Herb Jeffries puts the words on this,record with something in his voice that makes him a combination of Jack Leanord and Eddie Howard with a dash of that Dinah Shore “stuff’ tucked ffi. For .something to make you breathe a little harder, try “Flamingo.”
• Radio Review
Here’s .some info on tonight’s “Plantation Party.” (Don’t read this if you don’t like at least a small degree of “western” music). Featured will he Louise Massey and the Singing Westerner; Tom, Dick, . and Harry, vocal trio; Whitey Ford, M.C.; . and the Doring Sisters, another vocal' trio. This program has been consistently good in past months. The time is 7:30 p.m., and
it’s over NBC-R. WON - 720 - MBS
To you people who study late (wc don’t), here’s some “news”—there are I^BG news broadcasts at 11 p.m. ;)ind 11:,55 p.m. every night. Why don’t you listen? They take only five minutes.
WMAQ - 070 - NBC
We shouldn’t fail to mention “Mr. District Attorney” which will be aired tonight at 8:30, and if you don’t already know them, the actors are Jay Jostyn, Vicki Vola, and Len Doyle; with Peter Van Stee-
dgn’s orchestra.

tonight at 8 p.m., as tart and witty as ever. With Allen this season will On the Blue Network, the feature of the night is “Author’s Playhouse” at 9 p.m. If you like dramatizations of short classics, listen, by all means. WAAF - 9S0 - NBC be Portland (of course), Kenny Baker, with A1 Goodman and his or-
chestra.
There is a new angle, too. Each Wednesday night, an accomplished student from an American university, chosen by his or her fellows as “the most'talented individual on, the campus”—is to be presented oh the program. The selected person will be taken to New York City, expenses paid; and he will be given $200 to be applied to college expenses., According to CB.S, ten universities have responded to explanatory letters. Wc wonder what happened to Purdue’s letter. What do you think about it?
Health Service Daily Report F. H. Beairi and W. L. Gaulke, seniors,, were discharged from St. Elizabeth’s Hospital on Friday. Those released from Home Hospital oh Saturday were: T. W. Gardner, 0. J. Gordon, and R. F. Springer, sophomores. Also discharged there on Sunday were Max Jasol, sophomore, and Daniel Slahaugh,
freshman.
Intramural Sports Bring Recreational Activity To Campus One of the busiest spots on the campus is Intramural Field. After four o’clock countless number,s of students may be seen engaged, in varying sports. As many as twenty softball games may be in progress
at the same time.
The Intramural Department has brought athletic facilities to all the students on the campus. Those not active in an organization may par- . ticipate in the ward system. Links Tourney Under Way The Interfraternity golf tournament has reached the quarter-rfinals with one match of the final seven having been played. Theta Tau defeated Phi Gamma Delta. The other surviving teams are Theta Chi, Sigma Chi, Sigma Nu, Beta Theta Pi, phi Kappa Psr, and Delta Tau Delta, Later in the fall, intramural crosscountry and touchball will start. These matches and meets will all be held on Intramural Field.
Indoor Sports, Too
The Fieldhouse gym offers innumerable opportunities for athletic activity. Facilities for badminton, squash, volleyball, handball, weight lifting and miscellaneous exercises
are all available, d.l.s.
