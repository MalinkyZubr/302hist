Student Senate elections for sophomore and ^utdor representatives are scheduled for to- •' 'day from noon until five in the afternoon.
Fassports are required for voting,
Here you are. If you tbink Senate needs/ ipore competent people in it> then this is your chance to see that persons Whom you consider competent are elected. If, in later months^ you do not believe that Senate is functioning as it should, then this result is even more your fault than that of the Senate^ officers., You, have not voted intelligently, or
woiLS,e -yet, you have not voted.
If you have not voted in Student Senate elections when given the opportunity, then, there is no justification for any griping you may dpi If you were not interested enough to vote, you-have no right to criticize the resuj-ts,
T , qf the election.
. If y»u want a vigorous Senate, you, the atudents, had better start planning now tq put vigorous persons in office. Just because, a fplloyr is a good “joe” it does not necessarily follow that he would be forceful enough to stand-, up-for the students’ rights in the face of opposition. Remember this when you vote. If a fellow seems somewhat radical; and; likes to break the molds of convention, then Vote-for him, for wh^ was radical yesterday isi progress today, and' progress today will be-convention tomorrow. We must keep om evolving our political ideals, changing them to>nipetthe needs of a fast-changing world;
We-mupt not be static.
Everyone agrees that some institutions on
