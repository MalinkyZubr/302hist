Mr. Albert P. Stewart, university musical ’ director, is in charge of the university-arranged program for the week. The plays will be under the supervising direction of Mr. Gilbert Dunbar Williams, program director of WBAA, and faculty director of the laboratory group; and Charles Hart, student lab group-'Manager. Both productions have already attracted enthusiastic campus audiences at their former presentations. The first, “Lady Novelist,” was given by the labox’atory group as its first production for this season. The original cast is being retained and includes: Georgia Lou Flaeger, who plays Sybil Anthony, the successful lady novelist; Bruce Yates, her young professor husband who becomes irritated by his wife’s worldly success; Richard Kohls who satirizes all college presidents as the dignified President Schmidt; and Shirley Canning as the sweet mother who soothes her daughter, Sibyl, when she leaves John after a quarrel. The play is being directed by Ellen Kepner. The second play, “His First Date,” was presented last summer with great success in the Stadium play series. Part of the original cast will retain the same roles. Among these are Ellen Kepner, the attractive sister of Henry Tippet, played by Chuck Hart. Tippet is in love with Loraine Lotus, glamorous movie actress portrayed by
Allison Lilly.
The new members of the cast include Benny Burns who takes the part of the banker father of Henry. Mrs. Tippet is played by Sue Enders, and Virginia Lee Ruddell assumes the role of the maid. The play is a hilarious comedy which revolves around young Tippet’s attempt to win the glamorous actress. “His First Date” is being directed by Joe Martin. Fair and Warmer Things were definitely feeling warmer last night at 10:30 o’clock when the University Airport gave the temperature as one degree below zero, Fahrenheit. And that was warmer, too, when, you consider that at 7:35 a. m. yesterday the temperature reached the up-to-date low record, 10 degrees below zero, Fahren-
heit. Wow!
New Year Brings Tremendous Problems
By Joe Belden, Editor Student Opinion Surveys of America College youth of this new year is faced with some of the most staggering problems of modern civilization, further complicated by this nation’s attempts to make itself a better place to live. Unemployment continues to be a major U. S. problem, vying for attention with the war in Europe, which is bound to have its effect on business and on wages. On the first of Febi'uary monthly Treasury checks will begin coming to many of the aged of the country, and by the end of 1940 nearly one million persons will be receiving benefits as the gigantic Social Security progi'am assumes full stride. Student Opinion The Student Opinion Surveys, national polling organization of the campus press, has tapped the .college mind on two topics that may give a glimpse of America tomorrow: old age pensions and the income college youth expects.
Surveys’ interviewers found the usual student optimism. Almost two-thirds of the collegians don’t want the government to pay them pensions when they reach 65, and nearly 7 out of every 10 believe they will be able to earn $100 a month or more as soon as they leave college. The poll on pensions does not mean that students are opposed to Social Security for the needy. And college women differ with their male classmates. The Surveys found that the men are of the opinion that they should not be beneficiaries, principally because they believe they will be able to take care of themselves. Most girls voted on the opposite side. Asked, “When you reach the age of 65, do you think the government should pay you a pension?” students gave these answers: Men Womeh Both Yes 34% 66% 37% No 66% 44% 63% $100 a Month The S,ui’veys’ interviewers also
asked this question of a scientific-ally-selected cross section of students in strict proportion to U. S. Office of Education figures representing the entire national enrollment, “How piuch do you believe you will be able to earn from your first job after you leave college?” Not counting those who had no definite idea as to their future incomes or girls who did not plan to work, these were the results: $ 75 or less 11 per cent 75 to 100 ;..20 per cent 100 to 126 38 per cent 126 to 150 16 per cent 150 or more 15 per cent These answers take on more significance when projected against the findings of the American Youth Commission, which indicate that even in cities, where wages are higher, the typical youth’s weekjy pay envelope contains about $16. College graduates often get much more, but the cases are not many, and the average is much lower than what the undergraduates now expect.
Purple Tearn Seeking Revenge After Last Teat's Trouncing PROBABLE LINEUPS PURDUE NORTHWESTERN Sprowl or Blanken F .v Harman Igney F , Kroger Fisher C Klein Beretta (Capt.) G Vance (Capt.) Yeager G Shepard Opening their present season’s conference hardwood endeavors tonight, the Boilermaker net forces will journey to Evanston, 111., to tangle with Northwestern’s undefeated Purple quintet. The Wildcats, who are planning to finish near if not on top of the Big Ten basketball ladder, will be out to avenge a 35-24 licking suffered at the hands of the Riveters in a similar opening game played in the Fieldhouse last year.
Wildcats Favored
Foe Forward
550 Couples Attend Cary Club Formal Cary Club members and their dates, 550 couples in all, danced last night in the Union ballroom to the music of Anson Weeks and his “Ambassadors of Rhythm” at the Cary Club tormal dinner-dance. The evening’s program began at 7 o’clock with dinner by candlelight in the Cary Halls. Afterwards they adjourned to the Union where they danced from 9 until 12. Doris DeNel, Bud Prenctice, and the Anson Weeks trio presented the vocal arrangements. The backdrop, picturing an ed and his date walking to the entrance of one the halls, attracted a great deal of attention. Annual Road School Starts January 22 Meeting on the campus from January 22 to 26, the annual Road School sponsored by the University is expected to have an attendance of well over 1,000 city, county, and state highwaymen, along with equipment manufacturers. The annual Road Show will supplement the series of technical lectures and practical demonstrations. The Road Show will be open to the general public from Tuesday afternoon through Thursday morning. Special entertainment on the program will include a smoker session on the opening evening, Monday, January 22, and the annual Road School banquet on Thursday evening. The Highway Materials and Equipment Association is also sponsoring a supper and floor show on Tuesday night,' as weU as a novel aquacade, planned in cooperation with the Purdue athletic department, which w€l be held Wednesday evening, January 24.
In view of the Wildcats' record so far this season. Coach Dutch Donberg’s lads will entertain the Boilermakers in the position of slight favorites. The Purple have beaten Carleton, Washington State, Pittsburgh, Princeton, and Notre Dame in order, and have compiled their best pre-conference record in recent years., They have scored 199 points, an average that just misses a point a minute, while holding their opponents to 139 tallies, an average of about 28 per game. High Scorer Northwestern has approached its opening conference games with much the same lineup that Avill face the Gold and Black forces tonight. Dick Klein, 6 foot 3 inch sophomore, who leads the Purple scorers with 60 points, will start for the ’Cats at the center post. Dick really hit his scoring peak against Notre Dame last week when he collected 21 points, 7 baskets and an equal number of charity tosses. In addition to Klein, the other sorters are Les Harman and Don ^uger, forwards, and. Capt. Ad Vance and Bob Shepard, guards. All except Klein and Kruger are returning lettermen. Coach Piggy Lambert indicated that the starting combination for the Boilermakers would have either Don Blanken or Forrest Sprowl, sophomores from Hlinois, teaming with Bob Igney at forward, and bespectacled Dan Fisher at his customary center post. The veteran guards. Captain Fred Beretta and Elwood Yeager are expected to remain as fixtures, although John Tierney and Charles Caress, sophomores, may see plenty of action. Sophomores The little black books in which the scorekeepers keep track of things, will contain a large group of monickers new to the Big Ten warfare tonight as both squads can boast of a sizeable aggregation of sophomore stars. Blanken, Sprowl, Neutzel, Tierney, and Caress have been seeing quite a bit of action for theBoilermakers so far this year, while Dick Klein and Don Kruger have been carrying the torch of the class of ’42 for the Wildcats. R. C. Canterbury, CE '04, Dies In Highland Park, III. Richard C. Canterbury, CE '04, prominent University alumnus and building contractor, died Thursday in his home in Highland Park, 111. Funeral services will be conducted tomorrow afternoon in his home. Canterbury was born in Franklin Grove, 111., and while at the University took an active part in campus activities," playing both class football and baseball. He was a member of Sigma Alpha Epsilon, social fraternity. In 1906 he took charge of a farm mortgage business founded by his father, expanding it into the home building field. During the World War he was commissioned a major in the army quartermaster corps and aided in the construction of the Hogg Island shipbuilding project on the east coast.THE PUBDOE EXPONENT

But Incidentally— By Vladimir We hope you had a vacation of some sort. We won’t say nice because everyone else says either that or its equivalent. We just hope you had a vacation. Some didn’t. We know a fellow who did just as much joeing during the holidays as he does down here during the school year; it was i^o vacation for him. * ♦ * As for us, we’re glad to get back to school to rest. * ♦ * Getting back reminds us of the party at a professor’s house just before«we left. It wasn’t a masquerade, but two girls did come in formals—and one fellow came decorated like a Christmas tree. Yes, at least he had the electric lights. But let us assure you he was ‘lit up like a Christmas tree’ from a technical standpoint only. His breath was 0, K. Though he was quite a sensation at first, with his multi-colored lights blinking on and off as he walked, but by and by he drifted into a lethargy all his own. He began to walk gingerly, and only when he had to. He acted as though the switch on his right shoe was giving him the hot-foot. All-in-all, the boy was mighty uncomfortable. He just didn’t feel human. We think he was beginning to feel like a Christmas tree. We noticed a greenish tinge about his gills. Well, enough of him. It was a fine party. But soon the turkeys were gone. And all the peppermints had been eaten. And before long the crowd began to disperse. Finally just a few sticker-arounders were left, sitting in front of the fireplace, with fhe family. Daughter was stroking the cat and purring at it. Son gently squeezed the pet rabbit between his feet, and petted the white mouse his sister had brought home. Yoimg sister had just put the dog outside. Not much was said. The Professor puffed his pipe and remarked that he was glad the students came. His wife said oh dam it they made me miss Charlie McCarthy. ^ And the fellow with the lights just glowed.

Notice!! All ye Joes and Joesses of the Sweet Shoppe with no place to go, just walk to the Grill and there you’ll meet your pals. It hurts my heart, however, to see all those girls behind the counter working so hard to take care of all the orders. The old Sweet Shoppe, we realize, was a nice place for confinement. . . —B &B— . . . because we hear nowadays that the Grill is too “open.” My opinion is tha^ it was not such a smart idea to wait until after the vacation to fix it up. There can’t be any noon neckin’ now! —B & B— Here is a contrib received before the vacation which will pain many of you eds: Dear B & B Editor: We’re very low in spirits. The Venus of the Executive Bldg., Marjorie Mayfield, broke our hearts by saying she is getting married New Year’s Eve; Wow! Another good dancer gone. What will we do without her at tea dances, too. We didn’t get a chance for many dates, but at tea dances you could get in two or three steps sometimes. We will welcome anyone else to come and grieve with us, especially since she is marrying a fellow from back home. Darn it! Lonely and Unhappy.
To ease your worry, dear friends, I can say from reliable sources that blonde Venus Mayfield is safely and happily married now. —B & B~ On the Wednesday before vacation, as Jean Carrel, Pi Phi, was leaving the Recitation building, a squirrel fell from the building onto Jean. Now, what would a squirrel hold against a Pi Phi, especially Jean? —B&B— A word to the wise. Ease up on the dates around here, Hank Eigleshach. It may hurt your pride later to find it may just be the new car. We hear things around here ... —B & B— Pome found in a dignified senior’s “Heat book.” Blessings on the little dame. Bare of neck and knees the same. With thy rolled down silken hose, And thy transparent clothes. With thy pretty made up face. Which thy bobbed hairs jaunty grace. With red lips reddened more. With thy lipstick from the store. With all my heart I give thee joy. Thanks to the Lord I was a boy. —Yipppeeee. —B & B— And another gay young college lad has lost his fraternity jewelry to a Lafayette town girl. The boy ? Dick Springgate. The girl ? Jeff high’s Harriett Deckard. The jewelry? A Pi Rappa Phi pin. Love in January.

By Robert J. Deckard Tonight is the big night! The Purdue Boilermakers versus the Northwestern" Wildcats in one of the five opening games of the 1940 Western Conference basketball Campaign! —^fc— And, folks, it, the Big Ten basketball season, promises to be a torrid one. ... Illinois, Indiana, and Northwestern have already served notice on the rest of the Conference that they are in for a hunk of the blue ribbon. . . . Michigan licked Notre Dame, one of the nation’s toughest, as did the Wildcats. . . . Wisconsin has been going like a house afire. . . . Minnesota ain’t no slouch... . Ohio State ain’t no stinker. . . . Chicago’s outfit might be a threat as well as Iowa. . —fc^As for the Boilermakers, we aren’t quite sure. . . . They’ve come through the pre-conference games in pretty good style. . . . They’ve got the spirit, the ability, and the nerve. . . . And they’ve got a grand coach, Mr. Wa,rd “Piggy” Lambert. ... But we’ll stick the Riveters up there with the rest of the leaders this year. . . . And chances are that the lads will take care of themselves most efficiently. —fc— But for tonight. ... You’ll have to admit that the Boilermakers are starting off with a tough five. . . . The Wildcats aren’t kittens anymore. . . . The Evanston lads are strong and look mighty fine. , . .
Don’t overlook them this year in the title chase, . . . They’re hotter’n a constable’s pistol. —fo-V To start the 1939-40 season off, the Wildcats held little Carleton to, 12 points, winning that encounter 30 to 12. . . . Washington State lost next, 44 to 29; Pittsburgh was defeated, 39 to 33; Princeton followed, 42 to 26; Notre Dame came out on the short end, 47 to 36. ' The Boilermakers have come out on the good end of six of eight games, losing only to Southern California, 38 to 34, and DePaul, 37 to 25. . . . By dropping Oregon, Southern Methodist, Rice, and Washington State, four standout teams in the nation, the Boilermakers have established a reputation already this year that they won’t be easy to beat. . . . And tonight the Northwestern contingent will probably find that out. —fc— In other games throughout the conference, Illinois goes to Indiana, Ohio State to Michigan, Wisconsin to Chicago, and Minnesota to Iowa. ' — After studying around we find that Bob. Igney leads the Boilermakers in scoring, negotiating 55 points during the first eight games. ...

Igneyf Blanken PaceNettersIn Early Scoring Winding up the most strenuous pre-conference schedule of the year with a record of six victories and two defeats against outstanding foes. Coach Piggy LamberPs Current Boilermaker Basketeers can attribute their enviable, showing to a well-balanced scoring aggrega-
tion.
No less than five Riveters have contributed in the neighborhood of 50 points to the Boilermaker total as Lambert’s cagers have averaged exactly 42 points in eight games, slightly more than a point a minute, while holding opposition to little more than 30 points per game. The complete summary of individual scoring in the eight pre-con-ference games follows:

Dr. H. B. Eames, noted professor of musical art and aesthetics, will give a lecture recital on Richard Wagner’s “Ring of the Nibelungs” tomorrow at 4 p. m. in the Union ballroom. A discussion of the meaning of music will be given by Dr. Eames, and he will illustrate his lecture with piano selections.

The display includes thirty-four water colors and oils, all reproductions, rented from Raymond and Raymond Company in New York City. A short description of the work and life of each artist is hanging beside the pictures. The exhibit will remain on display until January 16.
“Life Begins With ’40” so ’txs said, and this is our first bit of work for the year. So here’s to a happy new decade. Maybe we’ll be the living in the foolish, famous, or fabulous forties, but Happy New Year anyhow. On we go into the social season of this year. Cary Hall started things off last night with its formal dinner-dance in the ballroom. Anson Weeks, who has appeared here several times, furnished the downbeat for the affair. Nice to see the kiddies “dancin’ with Anson” again. And did you notice the large crop of imports? Just shows you what Christmas vacation does to a guy. —H & H—
Bacon Raiser
We heard of a very clever idea in the way of parties or bull sessions . the other day. The affair is called a post-mortem party, and all the guests bring Christmas gifts which they received and do not like. Then, when everyone is assembled, the time is spent in discussing and griping over the gifts, and explaining reasons for not liking the contribution. Well, it’s different anyhow. —H & H—
In case you like to travel, and aie in seaich of a new place to go, we might tell you about the very ritzy new night club in Indianapolis. It is located right down town on Illinois street, and is called the Music Hall. New Yeai’s Eve marked the gala opening to the rhythm of Louis Pancio and his band. This week end Call (Deacon) Moore, “the hick fiom the sticks” and his popular band will play for dancing. —H & H—
Roger AmSler ... of Rensselaei, whose Hampshiie bariow won the giand championship at the recent International Livestock Exposition in Chicago. Slabs of bacon fi om the champion hog will be sent to President Roosevelt, Secretary of Agricultuie Henly A. Wallace, Governoi M. Cliffoid Townsend, and Lieut. Governor Heniy F. Schricker, by the Agricultural Alumni of the University. The hog weighed 305 pounds and sold for a dollar and fifty-five cents a pound. Sausage will also be served January 11 at the Agiicultural Alumni luncheon.

What is the Catalyst Club ? That is rather hard to answer briefly. It is not an honorary at least not a scholastic honorary. It is not an ordinary society, because it has an official initiation and members sport a key. It is hard to define, but the resulting benefits and accomplishments of the club speak for themselves.

FOR RENT
Not being a scholastic honorary anyone, namely, the good boys, are eligible. It hasn’t the prestige of a scholastic honorary, but I believe that it does more to permit students and faculty members to become better acquainted than any scholastic honorary. Such an informal group permits the faculty to find out first hand what students are made of. It permits the students to have that informal acquaintance with instructors that results in a better spirit and a better chance to discuss job problems that is beneficial to the student.

GOT A DATE?
What I am building up to is this. Why can’t the Mechanicals have a mechanical engineering “Catalyst” Club ? An informal group made up of the boys elected to the club by the proceeding group. It should have a fairly large membership with all professors and instructors in the school members.
A group that has fiequent parties, similar to those given by the Catalyst’s. Membership fee should be very nominal and keys provided. Is there a national society of mechanical engineers of this sort? If not why not stait a local club? —R. F. D.
Everyone has a good case of the “gliimp,” so far as we can tell. Well, why not? The next vacation is so far, far away, and the terrible time known as finals so very, very near. So let’s all be gloomy. This was hardly the spirit prevailing at the Gimlet-Gold Pepper dinner Thursday night. Campus activity people from the two organizations enjoyed a get-to-gether at the Sigma Nu house, the first of a planned group of joint parties for the year. According to reports, the idea was a great success.
