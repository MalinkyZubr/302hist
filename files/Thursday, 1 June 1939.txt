Two Good Men (An Editorial) Two Awards... ... are announced in today’s Exponent, the Leather Medal and the Best Teacher Medallion. We wish to congratulate the winners of those honors, Controller R. B. Stewart and Prof. Seibert Fairman. Although these are not monetary awards, Sigma Delta Chi feels they recognize true service not only to Purdue University as an institution, but to the entii:e student body. Their real meaning far outweighs any award which might be appraised in terms of dollars and cents. The Leather Medal and Best Teacher Medallion are the highest honors which the student body, represented by Sigma Delta Chi, can present to a member of the University faculty. \ Controller Stewart... ... is number one Purdue business man, responsible to President Elliott, and probably sees the University as a whole more clearly than any other person except the President. His duty is to collect and supervise the disbursement of all Uniyersity money in all its phases ... which is a man-sized job. This year Stewart opened financial markets for low-interest Purdue bonds under trying economic conditions. Stewart graduated from Wisconsin in 1923; spent two years at Albion college, pulling it out of debt, and took his present job in 1925. He received his Master of Arts degree in 1927 at Wisconsin, majoring in economics and finance, and was headed for the legal profession before taking over the controller’s post at Purdue.

SDX R. B
John L. Reeves, ’36, former University instructor, is in a critical condition in Home Hospital today as the result of an accidentally inflicted bullet wound. Reeves was found by William R. Wilson, a friend, on South Ninth street, Lafayette, where he had gone to practice target shooting. He was suifering from a wound in the abdomen, apparently caused by falling upon the .22 caliber rifle which he carried. Although he was operated upon immediately apd is apparently resting well, there is little hope for recovery, according to a report received at 12:30 a. m. An instructor here last semester, f ieeves taught biology at Ferris Intitute, junior college. Big Rapids, Mich., during the second semester. Rochdale House... ... of the Student Cooperative Association, elected the following officers Monday night: Lee Earns, president; Alvin Gillogly, secretary; Wayne Musser, treasurer; Max A. Kline, work manager; Herman Drabenstatt, house buyer; and Charles Biltimier, kitchen purchasing agent.
William Fultz, graduate of the University’s dairy production course, was killed Memorial Day in Logansport by a bullet accidentally discharged from a gun carried by a younger brother, Rudolph. The brother was not held to blame. Fultz, age twenty-five, was active in 4-H Club work as a youth, attended Royal Center High School, and came to the University from there. He has been employed by Swift & Co. for s the past three years. He and his brothers had taken the gun into a woods where they planned to shoot crows, when the accident occurred. > Women Students... . . . living in residences other than sorority houses or the Residence Halls during summer school mustreport their addresses to the office of the dean of women. It is necessary that these rooms be approved before occupation, according to Miss Clare Coolidge, assistant dean of women. Addresses may be reported whenever plans for summer school and living accommodations are definite.
Two Batteries To Represent University Corps In Camp Knox Military Activities
War games—^reconaissance, occupation, and organization of position, conduct of fire, observation, and liaison — will be subjects stressed in the camp routine of the cadet officers attending this summer’s ROTC camp at Fort Knox, Kentucky. Of 186 juniors eligible, 114 have signified their intention of jenrolling in the camp, which begins Sunday, June 18. Six weeks of hot road trips, survey problems, and firing on the range will begin after each man has passed his physical exam, turned in his civil dress for “issue” clothes, and put up his tent and cot. Rival Batteries Purdue ROTC juniors will be organized into two batteries, “A” and “B,” and will remain as such during the six-week encampment. If past years may serve as an indication, much rivalry will exist between the two batteries, as they seek military and athletic supremacy, and also attempt to outdo one another with a sort of “horseplay” on the side. Last year one of the batteries was in possession of the oth-

er’s guide-on flag throughout most of the camp period, and friendly “duckings” in the pool occurred frequently. Competition in athletics will include softball contests, tennis matches, boxing, wrestling, and volleyball. Citations will be awarded to active participants at the end of the camp period. Journalistic opportunity will be afforded by the camp paper, “The Guide-On.” Purdue Cops Honors Other schools supporting artillery units in the ROTC training are Ohio State and Xavier Universities, each with one battery. Purdue units have carried off camp honors for the past several years, both in military excellence and athletic competition. Capt. Stuart A. Beckley, who has taught gunnery to junior^ since 1936, will spend his last summer camp with the University cadets, before going to the War College in Washington, D. C., for final training for the rank of major.
Prof. Seibert Fairman Law Increases Opporfnlties For School Librarians Graduating teachers as well as undergraduates with junior or senior standing may enroll in the library courses to be offered during the summer session here, June 15 to August 12. Under a new state law teacher ( librarians must be included on the staffs of commissioned high schools. Opportunities for placement in high schools will be greater for those who have teacher librarian licenses combined with their licenses in regular subjects such as English or history, according to Prof. William Hepburn, head librarian. University library facilities will be available as well as those of other local libraries. Miss Rachel K. Schenk who has been studying at Columbia University this semester will return to Purdue to teach the course in practice library work and cataloguing and classifying for school libraries. Miss Alice Lohrer of Hinsdale Township High School, Illinois, will instruct in reading interests of children and teaching the use of the library. Track Board Elects Assistant Managers Roger F. Bone, Bryant, and Sheldon H. Wheeler, San Antonio, Tex., were yesterday elected to the positions of assistant track managers for the ’39-’40 season. In accordance with the present system, they will continue as senior managers for the ’40-’41 season. The electoral board consisted of the senior track manager, captain of the track team. Coach Phillips, and Noble Kizer, athletic director. Will Control Dust On Airport Road Enough calcium chloride to treat the gravel road leading from State Road 26 to the Purdue Airport has been donated by E. R. Cole, ’06, to keep the road dustless all summer. This half mile stretch of road will be used to demonstrate this method of dust control. West Lafayette city officials will cooperate with the University by grading the road and putting it in shape for the first treatment. Tau Kappa Epsilon.. . . . announces the formal initiation Sunday, May 28, of the following students; Joseph F. Sheetz, Lucerne; Robert C. Pelke, Gary; Delmar W. James, Crawfordsville; William S. Jessup, Goshen.

Stewart will receive this year’s Leather Medal, and the Best Teacher Medallion will be awarded to Prof. Seibert Fairman, it was announced yesterday by Sigma Delta Chi President, Don Terrio. Official presentations will be made by President Elliott at commencement exercises on June 11. The Leather Medal is awarded annually by Sigma Delta Chi, national professional journalistic honorary, to the man who makes the greatest contribution to the welfare, success, and reputation of Purdue University. The Best Teacher Medallion was created only last year, designed to recognize Good Teaching methods. Last Year’s Winners These awards are normally presented at the Gridiron Banquet, which was not held this year. At last year’s banquet. Prof. J. A. Estey received the Best Teacher Medallion, while R. C. Woodworth was named for the Leather Medal. Professor Fairman was among the first persons to be introduced in Exponent’s series of Good Teachers. The article which described his teaching technique appeared in the issue of March 18, 1938. Mr. Stewart has been controller of the University since November, ' 1925. ^ Both the Leather Medal and Best Teacher Medallion hang in the Memorial Union Building near the checkroom. Phillips May Take Three Trackmen To Central Meet Final examinations have limited to three the number of Purdue entries in the Central Collegiate track meet which is to be held at Milwaukee, Wis., Friday night. Coach Hermoh Phillips announced yesterday that he would take Steve Gutting, ace senior hurdler; Chester Kessler, senior shot-putter, and Allen Gaulke, junior half-miler, to the meet, which is an invitational meet held annually at Milwaukee. Bob Lemen and Art Bodeau were the only Boilermaker entrants last year. Gutting, one of the country’s ranking hurdlers, established a new state record of 14.3 seconds for the 120-yard high hurdles in breaking the tape at the Indiana state championships last Saturday. We Wish... ... to correct a mistake in the participation trophy standings which appeared in the Exponent Tuesday. Sigma Alpha Mu finished fn third place instead of Sigma Alpha Epsilon.

Controller Stewart put into operation a new accounting" system at Purdue, which has been directly copied by 20 other colleges and universities, including Indiana. His system has saved over ten thousand dollars annually in operating costs over the old method. He works not only for his office, but also for the student body itself. Only yesterday Stewart made a special trip to Indianapolis, merely as part of his work in assisting cooperative groups secure houses and living accommodations. Stewart is also an ex-officio board member of the Purdue Student Housing Coloration. “R. B.” is treasurer of Ross-Ade Foundation, through which the Stadium was financed, and secretary-treasurer of the Purdue Research Foundation. Mr. Stewart is a top-notch Leather Medal man ... and thinks he has the best job in the world, not excluding Franklin Delano Roosevelt's. Professor Fairman... ... is an old friends of ours, we learned much under his tutelage in Mechanics 1, and almost anything we might write about him would be prejudiced. The Exponent recognized his Good Teaching qualities over a year ago, when a feature upon his classroom work appeared on March 18, 1938, which may be found in the Library files. Professor Fairman came to Purdue in January, 1921, from the General Electric turbine engineering department. He intended to work on his Master’s degree, but liked Purdue so well that he stayed . . . and has never regretted this move. For many semesters his sections have closed among the first at registration, as each successive class learns of his teaching methods via the campus grapevine telegraph. He follows an open-door policy, always ready to

By Georgann Schilling With sobs of sorrow we realize that the number of columns remaining to be written yet this year are numbered. And so, after sharpening our roommate’s new pencil, we attempt to finish the job we began last September when Him and Her was started. —H & H— Perhaps you wonaered at first just what this column was all about. Confidentially, we wondered a bit, too. We wanted it to tell about campus social events—dances, trade dinners, unusual news, and a few of our own feeble thoughts. Glances at the social calendar of the year prove that it was a rather gala time. Perhaps you had something special happen to you at one of the big dances. Maybe you remember
help a student in out-of-class hours, or ready for a friendly bull-session. Most commented on by students is Professor Fairman’s carefully modulated voice and extreme courtesy in the classroom. He says, “Teachers should be courteous of course . . . there is no excuse for any other kind of actions.” We only wish another of Professor Fairman’s courses would fit into our schedule.
Exam Study Pointers Editor’s Note: At the request of President Elliott and Dr. Miller, “Doc’s” study hints for final exams will be printed in the Exponent until final exams are finished.
1. The use of stimulating drugs is always a dangerous practice. A large number of students have been using stimulating drugs for the purpose of enabling them: (a) —^to study for a longer period of time preparing for final examinations, and (b) —to keep awake during examinations. 2 Students persisting in the use of such drugs axe advised to consult the Student Health Service regarding the correct use of these drugs 3. Six hours of sleep is the absolute minimum necessary each night. The advantages gained at the expense of normal hours of sleep are only imaginary. 4 Students in a highly nervous state of mind or those unable to sleep the required number of hours should consult the Student Health Service at once. 5, Light meals and good ventilation of sleeping and study rooms will promote mental as well as physical well-being of student 6 Eyes are likely to become tired with long hours of constant study, but they will see more clearly if they have short periods of rest Students should be sure that they are studying under the correct type of light.
