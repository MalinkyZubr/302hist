At Forester's Wtibdland Camp This Summer
By J. D. Smith ———
Wouldn’t you welcome the thought of,spending your summer in a tent deep in the woods? The freshmen foresters are looking forward to such a time in Forestry Camp this summer. There is only one catch to this wonderful (?) summer; that is, they will have to work and study from eight to ten
hours every day. .
The camp is located on a new a^ea developed by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the Clark County State forest in Southern Indiana, near Louisville. The buildings consist of a wooden mess hall and study hall, ‘ and tents erected on board floors in which the students and faculty live. The boys will be started to work Work Starts Immediately immediately upon their arrival at camp; however, the first few days qre to be spent getting camp organized and learning the tricks of living in the woods. “Paul Bunyan” Crisp will be one of the first in-
structors to take over in camp to show the fellows how to care for their axes and maybe even show them how to shave with one. “Ci” Lawson will also help out by showing the boys the proper waj? to
handle a saw.
The staff this year contains the usual list of University notables; Professor Davenport, who is noted for his unusual knowledge oLtrees and shrubs and his ability to wear out the most enthusiastic' hiker within one day; Professor Herrick, who knows more about diameters and heights ofi trees than the whole school cduld remember; and Professor Spencer (better known as “Uncle Cigaif Butt”) who teaches the boys how maps should ]i)e made.
Geltz Heads Staff
Professor C. G. Geltz, who has been on leave of absence Since last year, will head the staff at camp. Professor Geltz is known as the
camp handy man, since lie is the camp doctor and first aid man. He“ can find as many kinds of shrubs and’trees that the would-be foresters have never seen as any other man in camp, or he can just be an
all around good fellow.
There will be play to go along with all the work, however. With three lakes within five minutes walking distance of camp, there will be plenty of swimming every evening to make up for the lack of hot water in the showerhouse. Every Saturday evening the boys -will be freeze leave camp to go into Scottsburg; or if they are more adventuresome they might go as far as Louisville, The foresters have made a practice in the past of licking the socks off the COt) softball team and
even the lifenr#ville tbam.
Cdriip yrill oifldially get undet Vray Monday^ iune 8, but the students
will begin arriving Sunday.

Walter Leifheit Pitches Game McCaffrey Hits Homer, Single By PHIL JOHNSON Exponent Sports Editor Crawfordsville, Ind., May 20, Wabash Field—^Timely hitting and fancy pinch fielding gave the Boilermaker nine their win number 15 today as they edged out a spirited Wabash nine for the second time this season in a bitterly contested return battle which ended 5-3 for the invaders. Walter Leifheit, sophomore right hander, pitched all the way for the winners, allowing 13 safeties before he chalked up his sixth win of the season. Thie Little' Giant congregation
Observers Predict Leahf Withdrawal As Protest Gesture By John T. Whitaker SPECIAL. CABLE To Chicago Daily News Foreign Service. Copyright, 1941. Chicago Daily News, Inc. Lisbon, May 20.—^The immediate withdrawal of the United Sil&tes ambassador, Adm. William D. Lgahy, from Vichy is predicted here today by observers, who believe that this is the only measure whereby the Anglo-Saxons could break through the reticence of the Ger-man-controlled French press and bring home to the man in the street the fact that his governihenfc is negotiating direct military collaboration with Germany. French Not Against British All travelers reaching here from France agree that 90 per cent of the French people are opposed to collaboration against - their former British ally and that many military quarters are capable of actual resistance to the policy being pushed/ by Vice-Premier Admiral Jean Darlan, who not only expects a German victory -but actually desires ■hnd works for it. They agree, however, that the French public has been cleverly confused by Nazi Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels in his manipulation of the Vichy press, even more than by the hope of concessions to reduce the costs of the (Continued on page 2)

played splendid ball all through the game, seeking vengeance for the 4-3 ninth inning loss they suffered from the Boilermakers at Lafayette earlier in the season. Although they were able to hit Leifheit too consistently, they were unable to bunch their blows effectively, scoring only three runs out of their 13 bingl6s. As a result the losers left the high total of thirteen runners stranded on the bases. Mac Hits Stride Forrest McCaffery led the Boilermakers to victory with a home run,'his first of the season, in the third with nobody on base, and a sharp single in the eighth. The four baser was a hard clout into left center field which cleared the fence just above the 344 foot marker. Don Blanken was the only other Boilermaker to' hit safely twice, smashing a double in the fifth just short of a home run and a nice single his next time at bat in the seventh. Happens To The Best Second baseman Harry McFerren had a lot of tough luck in the game, committing a pair of miscues, just the same number as he has made in all of the previous games in which he has played this season. McFerren opened the scoring in the first half of the first as he walked, stole second, and' came home on Janisch’s single to left. Wabash lead-off man Radatz retaliated the same inning, getting on with a single and coming home on Paul Emmert’s deep triple. Errors Did This McFerren and Blanken tallied on^ each in the third to give the Boilermakers a lead which they 'never relinquished. McFerren singled, went to second as Byelene beat out a bunt, went to third as Blanken was safe on Leach’s high throw, and coming home before first baseman Radatz could field the ball. Blanken, went to third on the play and scored on Doherty’s infield out. McCaffery’s homer in the fourth was matched by a I'un scored by Phillips. The Little Giant center- ^ (Continued on page 4)

Doc MitletGoes After Publicity Right; Pill Rollers Will Bowl Exponent Keglers
By The Urchin
Ordinarily one job of any newspaper is to tell the truth. And if possible, by fair means or foul, a newspaper may eipose something or other. This time we expose the truth about Doc Miller, Ancient of Days, jwho hangs his long white heard in the health service and reaches over to stroke it while telling “all” about his Pill-Rollers, Infants of the Hour.
Not Ignorant?
Now first of all, previous razz editions nothwithstanding. Doc Miller is not ignorant. Perhaps he just fools people into thinking so. At any rate 'Doc has tried all year to get some publicity in the Exponent in the form of news stories. Either fei.eling that it could not do Miller justice or that the good doctor did not need publicity. Exponent failed to oblige. So Miller, proving that he is no longer ignorant, took steps to remedy the situation. He arranged to bowl an Exponent team.
Now when a baby quits sucking its thumb so it can thumb its nose, that’s news. So when Exponent ' takes time out from writing stories to bowl so it can write about its own exploits, that’s netvs. It's also double talk, but it's one way to get Miller on the front page. So reas-
ons Miller.
Infants of the Hour Quoting the good Ancient of Days who kissed the blarney stone just once again, “Tell them we used to be good, but now we win from the best of them and lose to the wotst.” Which looks pretty good for Ye Expo. Whdn Ye Ex^io meets the Pill-Rollers, fnfants of the Hourj, in the Union bowling alleys at 7 p. m. nest Sunday, theare is a fair possibility that Miller will have to
beat the best.
AH of which adds up to one thing. Millex^s gang is finally up against a team that thinks it can win. Or we don't know the value of propa-
ganda.

Selective Service And You With the approach of June 30, the date on which the draft deferment for all college students ceases, potential draftees are commencing to wonder about their future status under the Selective Service Act. According to General Louis ,B. Hershey, who spoke in Fowler Hall Friday afternoon, there is little likelihood of future group deferments, since they inevitably lead to discriminations and non-uniformity. Instead specific cases will be considered, and the Act made truly “selective,” Those who will be affected by the Act fall into three groups: students who will return to school in September, seniors who will graduate in August or January il942, and seniors who will graduate in June. With regard to the students returning next lall, whether they are now registered or will be registered by the time the summer is completed, the University is recommending for deferment all juniors who are necessary men whose scholastic indices indicate that they will graduate with their class. In determining whether or not a student is a “necessary man in preparation for an occupation essential to the national health, safety, or interest, such as chemistry, engineering, pharmacy, physics, biology, and bacteriology,” the University committee recommending deferments is also considering such factors as: “length oi time which the student has been pursuing the course in question, his relative progress and standing in the course, the ques-
tion as to whether or not there is a probable shortage of trained personnel in this particular field, and his relative chances for employment or replacement in the activity for which he is preparing.” As for freshmen and sophomores, recommendations will be made only in “a very few exceptional cases where the students, without a doubt, are necessary men in special fields where there is a shortage of trained personnel.” All seniors who will graduate at the end of the Summer Session or in January 1942, will be recommended for deferment by the faculty committee. As for the seniors who will leave in June, their future under the Act will no longer rest in the hands of the University, but will depend upon the type of work they enter and their employer after gracjl^uation. The draft boards are doing all possible to place the proper man in the proper position, but before this can become successful, there must be complete co-operation by all parties. It is the duty of each registrant and his employer to present all facts and necessary information to the draft boards regarding deferment of necessary men. As General Hershey pointed out, this is the only democratic way of carrying out selective service, and those who do not ask for deferment when they are in vital positions are misguided by a false sense of patriotism. Each person should consider carefully what part his particular training and skill make him best fitted to play in the defense program. Perhaps it will be in the army at $21 a month, or again it may take the form of an industrial position. “The machinery is set up, and it is a democratic process. Each citizen must do his part.”

army of oc6upation, return many French prisoners of war and loosen the line of demarcation that cuts French economy in half. Isolationists Cramp Leahy The significance of Leahy’s withdrawal would be immediately obvious to Frenchmen, who made - much of his arrival and wrote in their press, despite the Germans, that the sending of such an ambassador to France in its dark hour reflected France’s greatness. It appears plain by now, however ,that Leahy, thanks perhaps to the activities of the Lindberghs and the Hoovers, has been unable to persuade Darlan that the Americans can or will act in time to save Britain and win the war. Little more can now be done with Marshal Henri Retain, according to most observers, unless French opinion is stirred to the point where the aged marshal will dismiss Darlan, as he dismissed Pierre Laval last December or take an airplane for Morocco. Petain Likened to Hindenburg Retain is described as infirm and as cleverly misinformed as was Germany’s aged Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg (who first admitted Hitler into the cabinet). His honesty and patriotism are above question, but its is increasingly difficult to get written information to him and he takes in virtually nothing verbally. „ America’s prompt entry into the war and the dispatch of tanks and planes to the French colonies as a token of naval strength would make it difficult for Darlan to bring the empire as well as the fleet over to the German side, in the opinion of qualified observers arrived from Vichy. Dakar remains anti-British and anti-De Gaulle, but it is not antiAmerican and it would facilitate American occupation if Washington declared that after the war Dakar would be returned to French sovereignty, these sources believe. The garrison there, roughly, numbers 5,000, including the rating warships by which Gen. Charles de Gaulle was repulsed last summer. U. S. Might Sway Weygand Few believe that the French African commander, Gen. Maxime Weygand, and High Commissioner August Nogues are capable of bringing Morocco into the balance on the British side, but all observers think this possible if American equipment could be landed. While the Moroccan army numbers only 120,000, it has been trained to expand its cadres to a total of three times that number. For instance, Gen. Weygand has only 24 first-rate tanks but has trained his cadres to

This correspondent revealed several weeks ago that Weygand had refused to go to Syria to organize defense there because he anticipated Darlan’s action. The Syrian garrison, however, is less than 25,000 and is short of every kind of equipment. The prompt arrival of equipment from the Suez area might enable the British to persuade this French force to come over—some, but not all—observers believe.

There is a chance that some of these might not be able to compete due to senior final examinations on Saturday. Five Boilermaker track records have been chalked up by four of the veterans. Ted Tycocki, who was active for the indoor season, set a new record of 23.7 feet in the broad jump in 1940; Holderman made times of 4:15.9 in the mile, and 9:17.1 in the two mile run in 1939 and 1940; Dave Rankin holds jointly a 23.6 record in the low hurdles with Gutting and Sandbach; and Jake Weber chalked up a new distance of 49 feet, 4 3-8 inches in the shot put last season. Spike and Shoe Following the meet Saturday, the Spike and Shoe Club, a newly fbrmed organization similar to the Dolphin Club, will hold its first annual fcanquet lu the Union, honoring the complete coaching staff and the seniors. The club is composed of all men who have received either numerals or major or minor letters in track. Selections for the Big Ten-Pacific

The Sports Gestapo
by Phil Johnson
• Twilight And Evening Stars ... Athletic Director Mai Elward received word from Michigan yesterday afternoon that the Wolverines agree to play the Friday game under the lights of the Red Sox Stadium in Columbian Park. This news was greeted with enthusiasm in the Boilermaker camp. The entire team is anxious to play a Big Ten engagement under the lights. Before yesterday’s news from Coach Ray Fisher of Michigan, there was a great deal of doubt as to whether the Ann Arbor team would agree to Elward’s proposal. Fisher’s team is Currently leading the Western Conference, and many were skeptical as to whether Fisher would take a chance on playing under unfamiliar conditions and risking his title chances. * * * * • A Very Nice Job, Mai Mai Elwarffcand Dutch Fehring deserve a lot of credit for arranging the contest. It is one of the newest steps in Big Ten sports circles, and according to Coach Fehring, will be the first conference game under candlepower. Fehring will not practice tljie Boilermakers under the lights, as it would put the invading Wolverines at a disadvantage. Both teams will be on an even keel, with many players of both squads playing their first game at night. * * 4: * • The Not So Little Giants This Wabash baseball squad doesn’t take a back seat to any team. Twice this season the Boilermakers have barely edged out victories. In the first game it was a Wabash error in the ninth which decided the contest. Yesterday an over zealous base runner left a base too soon, putting a stop to ap eight inning rally which could easily have meant victory for the Little Giants. Coach Fehring was right on the ball for the play. Had he not noticed the miscue there would have been three men on base with only one out and some heavy hitters coming up. • Nice Eye, Ernie Junior backstop Ernie Young, who has been doing a noble job behind the plate since Captain Fisher moved to shortstop, was hit on the cheek by a bounding ball from the outfield during the pregame warmup.' The shiner kept swelling throughout the contest. In the final frames the peppy catcher could hardly see from his blind side. His one eye was still good enough to keep the Little Giants from stealing a single base. * 4= * * • Small, But Plenty Mighty Before yesterday’s game Harry McFerren had committed only two errors in 106 chances during 22 games. His .981 average made him one of the best second sackers in the mid-west. His near .400 batting average adds stock to this assumption. Those two miscues yesterday just doubled his all season total. However, with only two more games left this season, this diminutive diamondman will end the season with one of the best fielding and hitting averages garnered by any Boilermaker in several years. Which just goes to prove that dynamite comes in small packages.

For Boilermaker Squad Playing in the first night game in Boilermaker history, Butch Fehring’s revamped and rejuvenated baseball team will face conference leading Michigan at 8:15 Friday night under the arc lights of Lafayette’s Columbian Park. Michigan Gives OK _________________
Michigan ofiicials agreed yesterday to th^ proposal offered them by Athletic Director Mai Elward, but stipulated that the Riveters must not practice on a lighted field, since the Wolverines would not have the opportunity to do so. ^ It is to be emphasized that all students will be admitted free upon the presentation of passports. Gates of the park will be opened at 7:15 and the game wilT start at 8:15. Plenty of special busses will leave West Side from 6:45 on up until game time. In order to get to the park students should take a KOSSUTH bus, which will go to 22nd and KOSSUTH streets—one block from Columbian Park. We May Take ’Em It is not impossible that Fehring’s vastly improved nine will defeat the high stepping Wolverines. Many things support this contention, for Michigan has not played as many games as some of the other teams in the league and have had the advantage of padding up their win column at the expense of some of the weaker sisters in the Big Ten. Captain Bud Fisher and his com-*' pany of Riveters have not played any games with Chicago which would raise their record of four victories and SIX defeats, for the hapless Maroons finished their season without a single success. Some Changes Made It seems that the Gold and Black is improving as the campaign progresses, while the reverse is true of the Wolves. Witness the final game in the Minnesota senes when, behind the battery and hitting work of John Emmert and Ernie Young, the Boilermakers took all of the fight out of the Golden Gophers and won in the tenth inning, 9-7. Last week, the unbeatable Mickey Stoddard proved to his displeasure that all men—and especially pitchers—^are vulnerable at one time or another. Mickey was not enough in himself to protect Michigan from defeat and surrendered his hurling staff supremacy to an upstart sophomore, Cliff Wise. Probably, Mickey and Cliff will twirl-the two games for Coach Ray Fisher against the Gold and Black. Thanks, Mai! The week-end games, regrettably, will write finis to the National Pastime^ on this campus for the year. Genial Mai Elward deserves much credit for promoting the noctural affair and it is hoped that a large
