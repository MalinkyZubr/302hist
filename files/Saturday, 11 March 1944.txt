perdue Konesty is a wonderful phra,se. Last semester it was more magnificeiit thaB' it lias beendn -years. In fact it furnislied the substance for some of the worst humor of the term—-Purdue honesty was a laugh. ()f course, there were exceptidhs; rhany of them; Jht. too m tests arid "quizzes, too iriariy t6rm: ;pa.pers arid reports were out-arid-outJlYi^ations of any variety of honesty, whetjher it be terrried “Purdue” or “personal.” Ba^ffelly, every student should be honest if he is il^Tiriril in the least. What then caused the situation in last term’s classrooms ? What will eau^e it again if something isn’t done ? I^st,: qf course, one can always blqme the warJirhis is a trite, overwofked excuse, but to rnany it is still good. S^oridjithere is, as usual, the alibi that it is the fault of the instrtictor or in the way certain ?corirses are set up. Third, one cari blame the individual who does cheat, and the enyiron.mentj everits, and motives which have caused him’To hiirt his elassmates> his school, and him'selL ■ . ^ ' l^dthrir probable reason for the present laxity is the fact that an unusually lar^e number,of University students inust meet certain schdlkstic standards in order to remain j in schrihi.

rivets of the wrong type were used IR the main center, seel^R of the airplane, through lack of Competent inspection. This was not discovered until the center sec-

visory and management officials, they would immei diately tRferRi me to shut lip and say nothing, r , “In my position as chief test pilot, I wass forced to fly this airplane against my better judgment. Immediately. upon faheoff, the airplane started a vicious rpll, arid pnly with the help of the co-pilot on the controls did we avert disaster. The airplane was returned to the field, and I immediately contacted Mr. D. M, Smeton, general superintendent of the B plant. He said: ‘Don’t tell anybody about it. We’ll spe if we can’t rig this condition out of the airplane.’ -“Whereupon ,the control surfaces of this airplane were rigged to make it fly straight and level. This condition caused severe strain and stresses on the control mechanism, which, in my opinion, was a seriouO flight hai^arid, I was instructed to sign it off as OK and
to shut up about it.
“By the time airplane No, 20 came out pf the factory, there were from four to seven hundred defects which required several thousand man hours to correct befpre the planps were airworthy. This condition'has constantly grown worse until, or January 1, 1944, there ,arp dozens of aitplanes standing on the west ramp, so hadjy iRrihlriteri that it will be many waeks before these planes can be repaired and delivered. ,
