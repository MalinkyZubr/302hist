► That^s What They AH Say ? We thumbed thiough the exchange ,papeis from the various Big Ten schools yesteiday afternoon to see what the other sports writers had in mind about the confeience lace at the mid point As you all know, theie aie no less than six teams with three games lost now in the running foi fiist division places This sextet of teams are Minnesota, Iowa, Noithwestein, Indiana, Wisconsin, and our own Purdue. Lopkyig in the papers of these various schools, the respe^ive spoits editors all aie wilting something like this i 1^ ^Second Place Is A Cinch' “We’ve had a lot of tough luck this yeai We should have beaten Illinois, and the two othei teams who beat us A share of the title may be out of oiu sight unless Illinois gets on the skids Howevei, our team is now over the early season shakiness, and now will settle down to go the rest of the way undefeated We’re even going to beat Illinois next time We’ie a cinch foi second place ’’ Now we don’t claim to be oveily smart, but some of these guys aie going to be wrong All six of them cap’t win the rest of their games and cop the numbei two spot Any of the teams are capable of trouncing any othei team in the confeience What it all adds up to is that Purdue or some of these other teams are going to have to battle their very hearts out oi they will end up telling Chicago to move over Plash f lllini Win Another Game This past week it looki like lUmois has won another victoiy—not in the Fieldhouse, but in the halls of learning And it is a moie impoitant victoiy than any one of their games this yeai Fiom all indications it looks like the entiie Illinois team will be eligible for the lest of the season, It's the fiist tihie that they haven’t lost at least one player in a gieat many years Last season they lost Heniy Sachs and Hoot Eveis by ineligibility The yeai before it was Bob Richmond All of you can remembei the troubles Doug Mills had a few seasons ago with Pick Dehnei and Lou Boudieau, the latter now playing manager of the Cleveland Indians Yes, it looks like the Illmi have won a majoi victory in keeping the en tile loster eligible We Predief'-’-Rough Sledding Ahead Although most peisons seem to take it foi gi anted that it will be Illinois by several lengths for the title, we want to join the school of thought that says they’ie in foi a lough time They have to play at Indiana, at Minnesota, at Noithwestein, and at Iowa At home they still Jiave to face Noithwestein, Michigan, Ohio State, -Wisconsin, and last, but not least, Purdue If they don’t lose at least two games befoie we play them in the finale, we’ll be very much sui piised
