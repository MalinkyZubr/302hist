February 20, 1937 THE men at Rice Institute battled furiously for dates with redheaded co-eds for a recent dance.. for economic reasons. Those who escorted “sorrel-topped Susies” paid 26 cents less than the regular admission price, while those escorting brunettes got a reduction of 15 cents . . . the unluckiest, those who dated blondes, only saved ten cents. —30— WHEN rival fraternity men attempted to appropriate his fraternity house, “A Bewildered Greek” wrote this open letter to the Michigan Daily: “Members of a rival fraternity have overrun our chapter house. You can’t go downstairs in the evening without tripping over several of them . . . —30— THEY constantly invite themselves over for meals in spite of a frigid reception. In answer to our earnest queries they blandly state that they enjoy our meals. What can we do in the face of''such compliment? It seems that those fellows just can’t take a hint . . . —30—* “TONIGHT was the last straw. Several of these rival Greeks asked me if I would leave my room so that they could study in privacy!” —30— CANARIES in the Zoology buildat Minnesota will have to chalk up theiV disappointment to bitter experience*. .. for more than a week, an earnest canary has been sitting on pieces of red and yellow chalk, but she is not discouraged. Two other yellow birds are perched nearby waiting patiently to take tbeir turns at “chalk-warming” . , . . What’s it all about? . . . part of a detailed research on canaries being made by a graduate studeqt!

Sophomore Cotillion Set For .March 19
Skull And Crescent Offers Free Ticket For Best Decorations
Skull and Crescent, national second year men’s honorary, will sponsor the annual formal Sophomore Cotillion Friday night, March 19, in the ballroom of the Memorial Union Building, W. K. Millholland, chairman of the dance committee, announced last night. The committee is at the present time negotiating with some nationally prominent orchestras, but as yet no musical organization has been contracted. One of the best orchestras in cotillion history is promised, as increased ballroom facilities will permit the sale of more tickets than in previous years. As has been the practice, the sale of tickets will be limited in order to give maximum comfort and pleasure to dancers. They will sell for two dollars each. Offer Free Ticket In a meeting of the organization Thursday night, it was decided to sponsor a decoration contest offering a free ticket to the dance to the person submitting the best plans. Any student is eligible to submit plans entailing band-stand arrangement, back-drop, and other decorative features. These plans must be turned in to Millholland or to the desk in the Memorial Union Building before 6 p. m. next Thursday evening, Feb. 26.

Junior Prom Candidates Present Party Platforms
Naturals
Naturally we believe it to be natural for us to be called the Natural Party, We have a group who are “naturals” for the job. Take Bill Bailey, S. A. A. vicepresident and Gimlet member, Rog DeLong, P-man in track, starring in dashes. Chuck Ehinger, Debris junior editor. Gimlet member, and distinguished student, and Tom Graham, the best known book salesman on the campus; executive, athletic, editorial, and friendship making ability characterize this foursome. Now there is Jack Goory, winning his P as a distance runner, who is a member of Reamers; Petie Light, Debris junior co-ed editor and distinguished student; Ron Murray, Tau Beta Pi, Scabbard and Blade, and distinguished student; just pick one who isn’t qualified. Platform Our platform is simply this. We firmly pledge to extend our utmost efforts to secure the ultra in bands and to make this the best Prom in the history of Purdue. The main girder of our platform is “Fair Play.” What could be more natural ? —The Naturals.
Seven Aces
Selection of men for public office, because of the large element of chance involved, has always been more or less similar to cutting the cards. Sometimes the public “cuts” an Ace . . . sometimes a Joker. It was this thought that inspired the name of our committee, “The Seven Aces.” We also had in mind substituting “card-cutting” for the style of “throat-cutting” which has been quite prevalent in the past. If you fellow juniors will vote the “Seven Aces” way next Thursday, we pledge ourselves to be Aces and not Jokers, by living up to the following points: Platform JL. Arrange a full week-end of pleasant entertainment, including the best Prom in University history. 2. Extend closing time of dance to 4 a. m. to allow for more dancing and to facilitate timely post-Prom breakfasts. In conclusion, we wish to thank the Student Senate for sanctioning open campaigning, for we feel that it will do much to eliminate blind voting and/dirty politics. —^The Seven Aces.
PEW Alumnae Convene Here
Common problems in the teaching of physical education among high school girls will provide the subject of a round table discussion this morning when 30 former University co-eds who were enrolled in physical education courses return to the campus for a special conference which will open at 9:30 in the faculty lounge of the Memorial Union Building. Among the topics to be discussed are; simple home-made equipment by Mrs. Catherine Mary Sample; health education by Miss Marion Russell; program and demonstration by Miss Hilda Schwehn; competition, intramural, and interschool activities, by Miss Veronica Brady. \

“Be a good flute player. There is always someone at the turn of the trail who can be charmed by a good flute solo played at sunset,” says William LaVarre who is to lecture Tuesday at 8 p. m. in Eliza Fowler Hall nt the first lecture convocation for the semester. LaVarre has had over 16 years experience in the South American wilds exploring the mountains and wilds for profit. Though he is only 39 years old he has long been recognized as an authority on economic research and exploitation. During the past summer, LaVarre accompanied by his wife, made his eighth trip into the South American jungles. Several successful books have gained for the explorer the added reputation of an author. He states that the only real requirement to be an explorer is thi^t you go because you wish to see what yon can see..

will be a mad scramble between Minnesota, Purdue, Illinois, and Michigan to see who will finish at the top of
the heap.
Gopher Defense The Gopher defense has held opponents’ scoring down to an average of almost 27 points a game. While accomplishing this feat, the Minnesota netters are second only to Purdue in Big Ten scoring with

Institute Of Campus Opinion Desiring to more truly refflect student sentiment within its columns the Exponent, beginning with today’s issue, ^ inaugurating the Purdue Exponent Institute Of Campus Opinion. On alternate Saturdays a new question will be pres^ted, with the appropriate ballot, for student consideration. These ballots will be run for a week and the tabulation of results will appear on the following Monday. ' It is hoped that such procedure will do much to get fairly accurate information concerning pertinent questions of long standing. Prominent topics which may be considered are: organized cheering sections. Prom elections, Prom Queen electum automobile ruling, compulsory freshmen dormitory attendance, hell week. University night club, and many others. In addition to topics chosen by tne Exponent, suggestions from students and other readers will be carefully considered. To facilitate this gathering of suggestions each ballot will provide a blank space in which the person voting may write the question he thinks is of importance to the entire campus and is worthy of consideration the following week. —Editorial Board.
IS THIS RIGHT??? . . . BILL MORRIS is placing himself in the running for a place on RUTH GREVE’S date list . . . BILL got MARY HUPFINE to get the date for him . . . when he asked for it his requirment was; “I want a date with the best dancer in the dorm.” IP YOU WANT to be unpopular: The Creighton U. paper at Omaha, Neb., sets up the following rules: For Women— 1. Make him think you’re bored. 2. Suggest dancing continually knowing that he was up late Friday night . . . 3. Pull out his tie to see if the ends meet . . . 4. Ask him to carry your fivepound evening bag in his pocket... 6. Wear low-heeled sandals when he is over 6 feet tall . . . For Men— 1. Spend half the evening bulling with some other fellow . . . 2. Dance with someone else’s date more than three times ... 3. Forget to comment on her formal . . . 4. Ask her if she’s trying to look like Hepburn or Garbo with her hair messed up like that . . . 5. Take her home early . . .
Cultural Or Technical? Within the next few years the engineering schools in this country will have to decide just how they can meet the standards of technical training demanded by industry and at the same time provide the liberal arts courses which are necessary to any well-rounded education. With the increasing complexity of the engineering profession the demands for a more thorough training in the universities increased. To meet this demand, the educators in technical schools increased the number of technical subjects and decreased the amount of liberal arts course required- The wisdom of such a policy is doubtful. President Conant of Harvard had this to say in the recent Harvard Tercentenary address; “Over emphasis of either the liberal arts educational tradition or the element of professional training is a real danger at all times. The utilitarian demand for specialized vocational training and the practical man’s contempt for useless knowledge go hand i^ hand. When such influences gain control, an institution of higher learning supplies training, not education, and with the institution’s most important contribution to the land.” Only too often have many engineers failed because they have lacked the cultural education necessary for any successful career. Last semester the course in the chemical engineering school was revised to meet the requirements of industry but the amount of liberal arts required was decreased instead of increased, German being reduced to one year instead of two as in the past. The medical schools meet this problem by increasing the length of time required to complete the course. It will be interesting to note if the engineering schools adopt a sijnilar plan or whether they will only meet the demands of industry and turn out men who are just human calculating machines and nothing else.—C. D. S. The Honorary Racket Declaring that “honorary societies are in many cases only mutual admiration groups,” Dean J. A. Park of Ohio State University told the National Association of Deans recently that some college honorary societies are “rackets.” Students pay about $200,000 a year in initiation fees to about 300 honorary societies, he said. Dean Park may be a bit vicious in calling them “rackets”— the college honorary societies are probably more like minor grafts. But they are undoubtedly grafts in many instances. A glance at Baird’s Manual indicates that every college student should be able to make at least one honorary in something. It may be military proficiency, or service, or activity ' in any of a dozen extra-curricular fields. Few of them have rigid requirements. Fundamentally, it’s just good business. The national officers adopt a quasi-aloof attitude until the prospective member feels that a bid is an honor; but the national officers snap like trout at liver at every initiation pasnment. They all started because somebody had business initiative. And they continue because human vanity has little sales-re-sistance. Everyone likes honor, and the feeling of quiet dignity that goes with a key.—^The Michigan State News.

What is your name?” “That’s what I told you. Watt’s my name.” A long pause, and then, from Watt, “Is this James Brown?” “No, this is Knott.” “Please tell me your name.” “Will Knott.” Whereupon they both hung up. —Swipped. MORE ABOUT THE DEBRIS GALS ... a certain PAUL DAWSON of the Cary Hall roster, got all bet up the other morning about DEBRIS PERSONALITY GALS . . . voicing; “If WINNIE GREGORY doesn’t get chosen as one of the PERSONALITY GALS, I’m going to see DEAN FISHER” . . . if DEAN FISHER has recently become one of the campus authorities upon BEAUTY, PERSONALITY, ETC.; it is one of his versatile accomplishments we hadn’t heard about. . .

Four Sports Groups To See Action Today
Tank Team, Squash Squad, Fencers, Netmen Participate
With four of Purdue’s athletic aggregations in action today, the Boilermakers end one of the busiest weeks on the sports calendar and provide the sports loving fan with plenty of amusement. Yesterday the tank squad arrived in Chicago for the week-end and their second dual meet in the Windy City this month. After their very impressive victory over DePauw on last Wednesday, the mermen are expected to come through with the big end of the score.
Squash At Illinois After a brief respite from their busy season, the squash squad once more swings into action against the Illinois racque^wielders at Champaign this afternoon. Winners over several very strong mid-western squash teams, the Boilermaker team should provide an interesting afternoon for the mini fans.
Fencing Northwestern’s impressive fencing squad, conqueror of Notre Dame will provide a tough assignment for the Purdue sword wielders here this afternoon at four o’clock in the Memorial Gymnasium. The Wildcats recently ended the long string of Irish victories, 9-8, while the Boilermakers were humbled by Notre Dame earlier in the year, 12 to 5. However, they have shown considerable improvement since that time. The decisive battle with the Minnesota netmen tonight will climax the busy week of sport activity.
