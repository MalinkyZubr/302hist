■ "i iv30Sditoir?»'''l^ote,: ■:• Bii<ieeeh by Prwident-elect . Frederick L. HovdO lasli'night.'
I vrta'' greatly pleased to have your invitation to dine -with you tonigbir ^ hnd to have an opportunity to say a few words to the most loyhl frienda^'^ if this university hai Although this is puy h>?st public appearance in t liafajfette, ]^tnu8tlbe brie^ for this Is a time of happy rWnion, not to
y be. dulled by speeoh-making, ^ | ^ ‘ I must address my remarks tonight to the problem of the contiWng ^
relationship between a university and its graduates. I cannot apeak ‘ l of pianaifor the future for they are not yet clear. Although university F m - I
presidents are supposedly {jiven great powers and authority, they must.,
operate in what is perhaps the most' democratic form of organization We have. Attempts to dictate are instantly recognized. The problem is one 0^ a relationship which causes intelligent men to agree on a concerted hnd cooperative plan of action.. ' . . Bon^jceming Fart Of The American Way In'this country we observe “homecoming” in Ifiir own unique American way-r^yet beneath the jollity of the occasion there is something of deeper significance. Every great institution of learning throughout the world, with few exceptions, has a festive time on its calendar when its sons and'daughters return to pay homage and respect to alma mater and to
yehew their youth.
^he act of returning somehow enables us to demonstrate to the imi-' vejtoity, and to ourselves, that education and learning are good things, < th^t We appreciate her giving intellectual life to us, that'we propose to prqtect aiid aid her against evil days, against all forces restricting
her freedom.
The alumni of this institution are loyal and proud to be hers for it ; is a distinguished institution—^made so by the creative labors of many people working as a team.' I -hope^'Sbon to join that team: T eXpeOt to be a bench wai;mer for some time. I hope that if I work hard, don’t fhlnk jtny coiirses, listen to the right coaches, and never miss a practice, I can make the varsity and earn the right to be called a Purdue man. Alumni And . College Presidents Must Work Together As alumni celebrate homecoming in an American way, so too are they qrgsanized^in an American way. I am told that uniyersity presidents 'caMi^t get along with alumni associations and can’t get along!. without them. The former I don’t believe.and the latter I'am sure .of. What fundamental differences' can arise when both' university administrative ofBcers and alumni organizations have the same objective?
EPDIE CYCENAS EEPORTED BEAD A sad note to the< Purdue’s homecoming football celebration is afforded by the bilef announcement by the naVy' department that.Ensign Edward J. Cycenas is officially dead. No details were given. Ed.Cycenaowas a rugged halfback on the 1942 Purdue football teaih and Was holding a regular position on the brilliant unde- p | feated 1943 eleven when an in- * jury put him out of action. Soon ^ after he was' transferred and . served lor some length overseas.
