British Still Seek Nazi Battleship Ships Set Trap To Avenge'Hood' By William H. Stoneman SPECIAL CABLE To Chicago Daily News Foreign Service. Copyright, 1941. Chicago Daily News, Inc. London, May 26.—^The most intensive hunt in the history of naval warfare was being carried out by the British fleet and air force today in an attempt to locate the triumphant German battleship Bismarck. While the Admiralty kept silent and concentrated on the search, it was generally believed in London that the Bismarck was still somewhere on the high seas searching for a way out of the mighty trap laid for her by the British. It was assumed that the British forces that combed the Atlantic, included such monsters as the Nelson and the Rodney, eaclb- of which displaces more than 33,000 tons and has nine 16-inch guns against the Bismarck’s eight l5 inchers. Bismarck Possibly Damaged They only make 23 knots against the Bismarck’s • 30, but if the Bismarck is badly damaged as the result of Saturday’s engagement as is believed, they may be able to
catch her.
Assuming that the Bismarck is too badly damaged to continue her saiding, two paths lie open to her: The northern route, north of Iceland, which would take her to the Norwegian coast and thence by way of Norwegian waters back to a German port for repairs, or a southern course to the coast of France and Spain, where she might find a temporary haven. The first would be infinitely preferable to the second and it can be assumed that the (Continued on page 4)
Deferred Men Should Act Now Says Warren If they plan to continue their study at the University next fall, all students now placed in classification 1-D under the Selective Service Act should apply immediately to the head of their school or division for the papers required for further deferment, according to an announcement received last night from E. K. Warren, chairman of local board No. 2.
Fill Out Papers
Failure to fill out these papers qt once will result in the student’s being subject to call at the close of school on June 8. This notice is applicable, however, only if the nature of the student’s study places him in a position necessary to the defense set-up, Warren said. Those students who have recently filed questionnaires asking for classification in 1-D are also subject to this notice, the board chairman announced, f.i.j. Prof, F. C, Hockema . . . assistant to President E. C. Elliott, spoke on “Observations in Other Colleges” at the regular monthly luncheon-meeting of the agricultural staff yesterday. Professor T. A. Coleman, associate director of agricultural extension work, served as chairman of the
meeting. w.e.r.

tSth Annual Air Show
Before approximately 20,000 airminded fans, Mike Murphy looped and dived the thirteenth annual air show and meet to a successful close Sunday afternoon at the University airport. Murphy’s Final Appearance In one of his final civilian appearances before he becomes a Lieutenant in the Army Air Corps, the “Flying Irishman” thrilled the crowd first with close-to-the-ground work in his Taylor Cub, and later put his Bucker-Jungmeister plane through a series of stunts. These included the difficult square, outside loop, such as only the leading American aerobatic ace can present. , Included in the two hour show were Jack D. Harrington and Joseph Halsmer in an exhibition of advanced CAA training and five coeds, Peggy Jane Davis, Lois Hollingsworth, Jeanette Davis, Pat Dickerson, and Nancy Phillips, who executed a series of maneuvers in Cub trainers. Mike Burson’s delayed parachute jump from 10,000 feet and a pants race, with the flying club members as participants, added to the thrills of the afternoon. Airocobra Not At Show Although the famous Airocobra was not on the field, three new Army ships made their appearance. The fast P-40, a Douglas bomber, and a new Beechcraft transport, were present during the show and roared low over the field when leaving- , The meet was sponsored jointly by the Flying Club and Glider Club, w.e.r.

In an effort to place the University’s grading system on an equal basis with those used at other Big Ten institutions, the faculty uanimously adopted the revised grading system proposed by the Committee on Grades and Grading Standards at yesterday’s "meeting in Fowler Hall.
Effective In ’42
Under the new plan, which is to be effective starting September 1942, the passing grades and their meaning are: 4—excellent, to be awarded for high achievement; 3—good; 2—^fair; 1—^passing in minimal objectives only.
. In addition to the passing grades, the plan includes two failing grades and one conditional grade. The designation of these grades was left to the descretion of the Registrar. These grades will be similar in meaning to the present D, F and I
grades.
Still An Honor Grade Contrary to common opinion, the present “H” grade is not eliminated in spirit. Under the new arrangement, an instructor may recommend additional credit for “students who achieve the highest passing grade in a course and does creative work of high quality beyond the usual requirements of the course.” “Such recommendation, accompanied by the evidence on which it committee designated by the Presiis based shall be acted upon by a dent. Credit so earned, not to exceed double the amount of credit given for the course, shall be used in computing scholastic index and for no other purpose.” Much Work Yet The delay before the system goes into effect is caused by the large amount of work required to recalculate scholastic indices, minimal credit hours for graduation, class designations and for the partial remission of fees. Objections to the present gradthat an analysis of last semester’s ing system, included the statement grades, indicated that 79 per cent of the H’s issued last semester were not in conformity with the authoritive definition of the H grade. Students, Faculty Confused In the discussion of the proposal in the report submitted to the faculty, it was pointed out that “The wide variation in interpretation of the H grade has caused much confusion in the minds of both faculty and students; a confusion which probably can not be dispelled by any alteration or amendment to the definition.” “It is doubtless true that the present base for gaging the H grade, in as much as it varies between (Continued on page 4)
Uniyersity Players Elect New Officers, Discuss Key Design At a recent meeting of the Purdue Players, Merle Keck, EE ’42, was elected president of the organization for the coming year. Other officers elected were: Martha Jane Fox, Sci. ’43, vice president; Roberta Walker, HE ’43, secretary; Jack Miller, ME ’42, treasurer; Rex Nash, ChE ’43, Pat Frigge, HE ’43 and Dick Kohls, Ag ’43, junior executives; Betty Gray, Sci. ’44,

Purdue Players is a social organization of students who work in the Playshop productions. The members are divided into two classes: the apprentices, who have worked at least 50 hours on two shows; and the players, who have worked at least 200 hours on four shows. The meeting also considered new designs for gold and silver keys. The silver keys are for apprentices, the gold keys for players, k.g.r.

school.
Other officers of the organization for next year are Dave Elden, vicepresident; Gifford Holden, secretary; A1 Arnold, treasurer; Richard Obarski, official contest director; and Ken Harker, honorary contest director, w.e.r.
Lafayette Court Tries Graham; Caught Burglarizing Kappa Sigs
By Art Hunter “And, Mrs. Graham, you say that ^you posted a $1,000 cash bond for your son’s freedom?” These were the words of Prosecuting Attorney George E. Weigle as we entered the County Circuit Court yesterday afternoon to cover the trial of the people of Indiana vs. James Urahara. Entered Kappa Sig House ^ “Jimmy” Graham stands accused of entering the Kappa Sigma fra--ternity house at about 3 o’clock on tlhe morning of July 13, 1939, with intent to burglarize, and upon this charge he is being tried ip Judge W. Lynn Parkinson’s court on the second floor of the Lafayette City Course House. Last Thursday saw the completion of the selection of a jury of one woman and 11 men, and Friday morning the court convened with Attorney Francis * Murphy representing the defendant and Thomas W. Hunger as assistant to Prosecutor Weigle, Housemother Testifies The trial began with Mrs. Maude
Campbell, house mother for the summer, testifying how she discovered the defendant in the house, whereupon she rang the fire bell' which brought approximately 25 summer students from their beds to capture Graham. Next, Ed Rohrbaugh, Sci. ’41, stated how he arrived downstairs fif st with pistol in hand in time to apprehend the defendant in the library. DU’s Plundered Too Other state witnesses who testified as to their part in the earlymorning fracas were: Allan Dilts, SAE, who was living in the house during that summer; Fred Mcmtague, Arthur Beddoe, John Burkhardt, and Doh.Grey, all members of the fraternity; and Bex Oyler, EE ’40, who testified that his suit had been stolen from the Delta Upsilon fraternity house on the same night.

The Third Term By The Termite Saturday night the Nazis sank the Hood. Thus terminating a long and adventurous life. Since the war began, the Hood has been sunk five times and damaged beyond repair three times according to Berlin. But even the British admit it this time. * * * Following the loss of the Hood, the unsquelchable Nazis press declared that the German Navy will bring into reality, and at the end of the war will be the guarantor of the American ideal of freedom of the seas. All of which makes us sore as hell, because we’re darned if we need to call in Adolf to uphold our ideals. * IK f Sunday night the Expo team was defeated by the pillrollers. And we’d like to forget the affair, except that we’re too amazed at Butch Miller’s style of bowling. It’s really wonderful. * # * He picks up his ball, glares at the pin boys, shuffles his feet a couple of times, and he’s off. He takes one side step, scampers up to the wrong side of the foul line in about 20 steps, and drops the ball, which weaves drunk-, enly down the alley for a split. * * * Out East, a noted educator says, “Women must learn to speak for themselves.” No we don’t know what to think about this affair. The only explanation we have is, that the educator must not get around very much. * * * One of the first headlines we saw when we picked up

Jinudij^ JalL No More 'H's' h With the establishment of a new grading system yesterday afternoon, the faculty of the University have done away with a great deal of confusion that has existed in the minds of the students, the faculty, and other universities and colleges. The source of misunderstanding was largely in the present “H” grade, which “attempted to recognize and reward students who did creative work of high quality beyond the course requirements.” However, in a majority of cases this definition has not been followed by instructors. Instead “H’s” have been awarded purely on a percentage basis to students who ranked very high in the course requirements. In addition, the present system has placed an unjust handicap on students, especially seniors and graduate students, entering other schools, since an “H” was often transferred as an “A,” and “A” as “B,” etc., because of misunderstanding as to the actual values of the Purdue grades. Examination of the new system reveals that it differs from the present theoretical grading plan, but also that there is little change from the present actual practice of awarding passing grades. Under the new plan the top passing grade will be a “4,” awarded for “unusually high achievement.” The other passing marks will be “3,” good; “2,” fair; “1,” passing in minimum essentials only. Thus the new “4” will correspond to the present “H” in that it will be given on the same basis as the ‘H” is now awarded by instructors, a basis which is not strictly in accordance with the literal definition o fthe “H” grade. Also the definitions of the “3,” “2,” and “1” follow closely the present interpretations of the “A,” “B,” and “P” grades. Thus the “changing of the grading system to include four instead of the present three authoritative passing grades, based on regular class assignments, is but an acknowledgement, long overdue, of a practice in vogue among most of the members of the instructional staffl” In addition, the new plan does not lose sight of the necessity of recognizing and rewarding students who do creative work of high quality. In the future an instructor may recommend such a student for additional credit. This recommendation must be passed upon by a committee, and the credit given used in “computing the scholastic index and for no other purpose.” Therefore, in September, 1942, the University will put into use a grading system that will be in harmony with those used at other schools, a, plan that will recognize “unusually high achievement in the course requirements,” and also “creative work of high quality beyond the usual requirements of the course.”

Well, people, they’re finally here, and we do mean finally. Get in there and pitch and good luck to you. Funny what finals will do for a person. For instance, we saw Buttons Burton, who usually is so careful about her appearance, downtown Saturday night in slacks. For shame. Buttons must have been on the Debris picnic and not' bothered to change her clothes. Incidentally, we hear that was a pretty good picnic. They tell us most of the gaijig went swimming, that is, the boys, in their clothes and otherwise, and Steve Minton and Patty Moffitt were unfortunate enough to have the swimmers uproot their hiding place just at the wrong time. Seems sort of silly to us seeing that Patty had a date with an ATO later and seeing that Ely, also an ATO, was one of the swimmers. Rather careless of her we think. Say, what’s going on around here? Sunday afternoon, we saw Donna Tyrholm and Tex Kramer walking down the street by themselves and later pay their own way to a show. It’s a heck of a note when a couple gals like that go around without dates on a beautiful Sunday afternoon. What is it, gals. Sophomore Slump already, or are the fellows all studying? Well, that’s all for now. Remember, though, that it’s easier for a person to draw the line than it is for him not to step over it later.

Burt Anthony Named Captain Of 1942 Varsity track Team Burton Anthony, the Boilermaker’s ace quarter-miler, was elected captain of next year’s track squad at a meeting of the “Spike Shoe Club,” newly-formed cinder honorary, held last Saturday night. Burt will supplant Ed Holderman as the leader of Coach Herman Phillips track forces.
One of Conferences Best
The new captain, whose home is in Kenilworth, III., has been knocking a lot of Eiveter records around lately, and is regarded by coach Phillips as one of the best quartermilers in the Big Ten. Burt upheld the Boilermaker mentor’s statement by grabbing third place in the recent Conference Indoor Meet held
here at Purdue.
Besides)^ the above-mentioned showing, the flashy speedster also holds the Riveter freshman record for the 440, and is a member of the record-holding mile relay team.
First President
Burt is also the flrst president of the “Spike Shoe” organization, and is in the Gimlet and “P” Men’s clubs. He is a junior in the’’school of mechanical engineering, and a member of the Delta Tau Delta
Fraternity.

Big Ten Baseball Race Hinges On Wolverine, Wildcat Series: Iowa Has Chance At Crown
The winner of the Big Ten baseball crown will be decided this coming week-end when the conference leading Michigan nine finishes their schedule with a two game series against Northwestern. By winning one of the games, the Wolverines can assure themselves of a tie for first place in the final Big Ten standings. Only Iowa has a mathematical chance of sharing honors in the race, and to achieve their aim, the Hawkeyes must win all of their four remaining games. Batting Power Northwestern, who last year shared the Big Ten crown wi.th Illinois, has experienced a hit and miss season. Their record shows five wins and five losses, but this record doesn’t reveal the true
strength of the Wildcats. The speciality of the team is batting and their treatment of enemy pitchers is usually of a savage variety. In last Saturday’s game against Wisconsin, the Northwestern batters hammered out 15 hits to completely smother the Badger nine with a 20 to 8 beating. If the Wildcat batters make their policy one (^f rudeness in the coming Michigan \ series, the Wolverines may lose the Big Ten race; a chase in which they have led the field for the entire season. Of course, to achieve a Michigan downfall, Iowa will have to play spectacular ball. The Hawkeyes have a record of five wins and three losses with four games remaining on their

Walter Leifheit, sophomore right hander, led the Varsity nine to a 4-1 victory over theEreshman squed yesterday afternoon in the annual intersquad battle that officially ends the diamond season. Leifheit allowed only six hits and gave but one free pass as he struck out 14 year^ng batters and hit a sharp single during one of his three trips to the plate.
A sihall slender southpaw, Dick Jarvis, withstood the onslaughts of the Varsity batters for the full nine innings, striking out eight men during the course of the battle. He kept the winners’ 11 hits well scattei^ed, but a couple of errors by his teammates and two untimely walks decided the fray for the Varsity.
Young Stars Again
Backstop Ernie Young again led the Boilermakers at the plate, hitting a long triple and a hard single in his two times at bat and scoring

Sports Gestapo ^ by Phil Johnson • Great Going, Golfers
That surprise upset on the West Lafayette Country Club golf course Saturday when the Boilermaker links squad conquered a highly favored Notre Dame fivesome for the Big State Championship was probably the most startling, upset of the
current academic year.
Notre Dame’s flashy team, rated one of the best in the mid-west, had already earlier in the season handed the Gold and Black golfers a smart 18-7 licking with their Captain Pehlig tallying a pair of 73’s. Everybody, including us, expected them to repeat. After all, they had won 10 of the last 11 state matches. That was nice shooting golfers, Knipp, Dahl, McDaniel, HofFer, and

• Dr. Cole Stars Dr. Miller’s ace assistant, Djr. Cole, left his white coat and his southern accent in the confining walls of the Health Service yesterday afternoon to become at sharpmouthed base umpire for the annual Freshman-Varsity battle. Doc did a very nice job, and ehierged from the conflict unscathed. Nice operating, Doc!
• It Can't Happen Here There is a slight possibility that the Boilermakers will play no more night ball, at least in Columbian Park. One of the sophomore managers had su^h a scare that he almost gave up managing. While chasing a foul fly with his flashlight he ran face to face with a caged lion. His flashlight trembled the remainder of the evening. He found out that there was a zoo in Columbian Park the hard way. schedule. This week-end they will meet the Wisconsin nine on the Iowa campus diamond and the following week the Hawkeyes will meet Ohio State. Since Illinois,, Indiana, and Purdue have completed their scheduled games and Ohio State is idle, the only remaining conference action this week will be the MinnesotaChicago series, which should be a Gopher picnic. j.d.f.
Congratulafions! Carl Hipp, ME ’43, of Johnstown, Pa., was unanimously elected honorary captain of the freeman baseball squad for the 1941 season yesterday. An outfielder, Hipp bats left-handed in the clean-up spot, and leads the frosh squad in hitting. two of his team’s four tallies. Harry McFerren and Bill Carson both hit two singles during their times at bat. McFerren scored the initial run in the first as he led off with a single and came home on Burghardt’s high throw to first. Two Triples In Row A triple by Blanken and Young’s three baser to the same spot followed by a hit by Rawles scored another pair for the Boilermakers in the third. Bill Burghardt’s single followed by Jones’ hard hit double in the fourth frame accounted for the only yearling run. The final Boilermaker marker came in the fifth as Young walked, went to second on a wild pitch, and raced home on Bill Burghardt’s fumble of Jim Rush’s hard hit ground ball. Tipp Tries, But . . . Carl Hipp started a final frosh rally in the eighth with a double down the first base line, but died on base as Leifheit handled the following three batters in order.

silon house before entering the Kappa Sigma fraternity. Bridewell’s Guest In her second trip to the stand as a defense witness, Graham’S slight, gray-haired mother, testified how she posted the aforementioned $1,000 bond for her son’s liberty; that he later left Lafayette and journeyed to Chicago; and that she received letters from him in September, 1939, and in December, 1940, at which time he was in a house of correction. This “house of correction” was Chicago’s famous Bridewell where Graham was serving a year’s sentence for burglarizing a fraternity house in Evanston. Immediately after his term at Bridewell ended this May he was brought back to Lafayette and arraigned for trial. The courtroom spectators came out of their lethargy as the next witness, Miss Nadine Howard, was called. Nervous at first, the comely Miss Howard spoke in barely audible whispers until requested to speak out for the benefit of the jury. She told of meeting “Jimmy” at the hotel where they both worked—she as a waitress. Still Loves Jimmy Continuing, she described her monthly visits to Graham while he was in Bridewell and said that she had come down here, entirely at her own expense, to testify in his behalf. In reply to Murphy’s query if she still loved “Jimmy” and wished to marry him, she nodded in assent.
Hood’s Loss Shocks Britain Britain has been shocked to the last man, woman and child by the destruction of the 42,100-ton battle cruiser Hood in its battle with the Bismarck Saturday morning. People were talking about nothing else yesterday and today and naval experts were wracking their brains to discover how it happened. As one man the nation is praying that something may happen to the Bismarck before she makes port. It-seems to be generally agreed that the Hood sank simply because she was outclassed by a faster, more heavily protected and more powerfully armed ship manned by first-class sailors. Causes Ship Reassessments The Bismarck’s performance has force dthe reassessment of Britain’s remaining heavy units and their ability to cope with such a ship. It has also resulted in the careful examination of the American battle fleet and the ability of its more modern units to deal with the Bismarck or Tirpitz if an engagement ever takes place. The result of this appraisal is the discovery that Britain has only two ships and the United States only two that could pursue and stand even a chance of successfully engaging either the Bismarck or her sister ship, the Tirpitz.
Meat cutting experts from Swift and Company of Chicago will give a demonstration tomorrow night at 8 o’clock in the auditorium of the Home Economics Building under the sponsorship of the University •foods department. The program is primarily for members of the University commissary and purchasing department staffs and cooks from fraternity, sorority, and co-operative houses, but will be open to the public. A sound motion picture, covering the purchasing preparation, and cooking of^ various cuts, will also be shown, w.e.r.
wide limits according to the views of the individual instructor, is prejudicial to the student. Also, the H grade is supposed to be measured according to a scale which is quite different from the standard established for the present A, B and P grades.” The other major objection to thp existing system was, “Often our students transfer to other colleges using the commop grading system. These students have reported that their grades at Purdue have suffered from the exchange because of the fact t|hat the H grade at Purdue is given an A equivalent at the college in question.”
The navy is building 48 blimps as a part of its air expansion program and intends to use them in basic training for recruits.
This is reasonable in the respect that A represents the highest letter grade of most colleges. However, following the «ame plan, Purdue grade of A then becomes the equivalent of the grade B etc., resulting in a sacrifice of the Purdue grades in favor of the recipient school.” Planning Committee The report containing the newly adopted plan was drawn up and submitted to the faculty by a committee composed of Professors L. E. Allinson, R, C. Corely, H. H. Remmers, C. K. Robins, and F. W. Greve who served as chairman.
