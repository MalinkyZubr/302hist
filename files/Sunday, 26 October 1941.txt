'lhat Damned Blocked Punt In fact it seemed like the margin
would be from the same cause that lost theis game in 1939 and the Ohio State at Columbus last week, that blocked punt But the Boilermakers nemesis of the Boilermakers A recovered something that they had lost after the fust few minutes of play in that mid part of the final period, something that period the Homecoming throng one of the most
thrilling and exciting finishes ever
seen in the stadium
At the beginning of the first quarter the Boilermakers leased an attack which seemigly was te stuff
Purdue Iowa tat outplayed te Buckeyes for a att
last week, but tey failed completely to capitalize on breaks and were unable to make any serious treats. A fumble on one drive at te 20 by Carter and a 15 yard penalty on another drive at the 15 put the stoppers on the Boilermaker offensive and cooled their ardor for a full two
quarters.
Hawk^yes Fail To Score The Hawkeyes were in charge of the play in the second quarter, but not enough so as to enable them tp' score Their high-powered passing attack for which everyone was waiting was released just before halftime but was completely stymied by an alert Riveter secondary. Second Half An Iowa offensive sparked by Green, Meites, and Farmer wis halted, and a,Boilermaker offensive that looked like it had great possibilities got underway It was slowed on their own 44 when Petty lacked just one inch of a first down.
