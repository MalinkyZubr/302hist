Activities Bureau Formulates Plan For Selecting Five Junior, Senior Officers
Applicants Should Turn In Petitions Meeting at their second regular session in the Union last night, the nine members of the Activities Bureau Advisory Board formulated the plans for selecting officers to man the new activity. Five junior and senior officers are needed immediately in accordance with the tentative Bureau constitution. The positions to be filled within the next week, are senior Bureau secretary, co-ed; two junior secretaries, co-eds; and three junior assistant directors, eds. Any junior or senior may make formal application for these positions by stating his qualifications and desires in a petition to be handed in to Director Leon Jacob-
son or the Union desk on or before 6 p. m. Monday night, October 10. Secretarial Work The work of the co-ed secretary will be primarily secretarial, as she will serve as secretary both for the Bureau and the Advisory Board. The junior secretaries will assist in office work, filing, doing contact work, and will help in the correspondence. Junior managers will have positions of responsibility corresponding favorably to other junior activities posts on other major campus activities. All juniors will have the sophomore and freshman workers under them. . Experience,^cholastic indices, other activities, and interest in personnel and activities work should be included in the formal petition for
'Opportunity To Get In On Real Actiyity* a post, which is to be submitted to the Board. “Beal Opportunity” “Here is a real opportunity for interested students to get in on the ground floor ip a top notch activity,” said Board Member Fred Ahrens, dramatics representative, of the jobs being offered on the Bureau. Board members last night tried to make it clear that they were serving, representing the student body as a whole, and not just the particular activity of which they happen to be a member. To be successful, the Bureau hopes to represent and work for every activity on the campus.

Thursday# October 6# 1938
University of Texas.. , . . students have gotten into quite a stew over the Daily Texan’s recent campaign to add co-eds to the cheer leading staff. Today we are reprinting some of the editorials which appeared in the Texan because we suspect that a similar situation may some time arise at Pm-due. The reason we suspect that is because our own cheer leaders have been playing with the idea and may consider giving it a try. We wonder what Purdue students would think abput co-ed cheer leaders. Girl Yell Leaders Finally someone has decided to take the initiative and try to do something about the yelling situation. Presley Werlein, head yell leader, has announced that he wants two of his four assistants to be girls. Unless something stronger than public opinion intervenes, he shall have them. The students have approved the plan. Several of the girls’ organizations are behind the movement and are offering candidates for the two positions. A survey conducted by the Bureau of Student Opin‘ion last May indicated that 62 per cent of the students favored the plan of electing two girls. “Several organizations which have pledged supsport have expressed the opinion that it should be considered an honor to hold a position as assistant yell leader for. the University students,” Werlein has said. And they are right. Other schools—^L.S.U., which will have its “tops” in girls yelling at Saturday’s game is a notable example—^have considered the position as such. It is believed on this campus that The University of Texas is the most democratic in the United States. The election of two girls to the yell staff will further support this opinion. The benefit of the plan for the entire student body: It will create more interest in the yelling situation than any other plan. Perhaps, as it has been “pointed out,” it is not necessary to yell at a football game to have school spirit—but it helps a lot. Girl Leader Opposition Intended No Discourtesy To the Editor of the Texan: There was no discourtesy in bringing up opposition to Presley Werlein’s plan having girl cheer leaders, to our knowledge. Last Sunday’s Texan brought the matter forward for the first time this year. You may recall that many of us last spring through Orange Jackets expressed our disapproval in a Texan article; and as nothing further was done about it, we considered the matter dropped. Since both the Kappas and Thetas by withdrawing their candidates have expressed disapproval, it seems evident that there must be another side to the controversy. , Before definite action is taken, may we suggest that both sides of the-.question be discussed and a thorough understanding be reached. —SARA JEAN COSNER I'm Glad To Hear It To the Texan Editor; I am glad indeed that no discourtesy was intended

in bringing up opposition to the plan of having girl yell leaders. If I may, I desire to answer the points by Miss Cosner. Articles regarding the election of girl yell leaders were published in the Summer Texan of August 28, 1938, and in The Daily Texan of September 16, 1938. A representative poll taken by the Bureau of Student Opinion last May indicated that a majority of. students on the campus desired girl yell leaders. Since such a majority expressed themselves “pro” the idea, I thought any discussion should be ended and the idea carried out. - Regarding the Thetas, they have never entered a girl in the race. I am not trying to “jump the gun” on anybody or anything. I am merely doing what I think the students desire. Also, I desire to point this fac^: out; The Handbook does not state whether the assistants as follows; “There shall be elected not more than four assistant yell leaders at the first rally in the first semester, any student being eligible to compete.” The Hanwbook does not state whether the assistants shall be male or female, PRESLEY WERLEIN, Head Yell Leader

The group pictures of the fraternities and sororities are now being taken for next year’s Debris, and of all the photos that you have ever had taken this one is the most important. These likenesses—or unlikenesses, as the case may be—will 'be making or breaking of yburl blind date next year. Here is a little problem in math: There are 180 girls going through rush this year, of this 180 only 100 or so will be pledged. Now if you will sit down with your educated sliver and figui’e this out, you’ll discover that this is only a 55 per cent efficiency. Of this 55 per cent there will be at least 5 per cent that will get into the sorority that was third choice. This makes sorority rush 50 per cent efficient. It’s no wonder the co-eds on this campus aren’t tops with all of this on their shoulders. So far this year we have noticed that the following three freshman girls getting that tjTpical Purdue first-semester rush: PEGGY DAVIS, VIVIAN PETERSON and HELEN LANG. We hope that the popularity will hold out, girls, and when pin time comes around, that you will hold out. Here is a suggestion for you sorority girls on how to get your rushees to sign up for your house on preference night. Get your alunmi to call the girl and talk to them. Of course if you’re caught at it you’ll get into trouble, but who is
‘Whatcha mean I don’t know values ? I got five years for one just like it!”
going to know you’re doing it ?...
I understand that there is some talk going around that the University is going to install cushioned steps around the foot of Heavilon Hall, but of course this would not interest you—why do we even bring these things up. After watching Cary Hall NW President Hal Lownie and WRH Pete Wallace for two weeks, we still can’t figure out who’s doing the rushing. At any rate the WRH gals are getting tired of these hour and a haK phone calls that Pete has to
take while lying on her stomach in the hall.

Boilermakers Work On Pass Offense; Entrain For Minneapolis, Minn., Today Two Gopher Backs Reported Out Of Action For Riveter's Western Cpnference Opener Saturday Boilermaker preparations for the crucial Big Ten opener against Minnesota Saturday were virtually completed yesterday with an extended scrimmage session. Emphasis was placed on the development of a long passing offense.
The Boilermakers will wind up
their drill with a light session todjiy before boarding the train enroute to Minneapolis. Pessimistic Outlook Reports from the Gopher camp revealed a pessimistic outlook for the Boilermaker battle. Three veterans and one reserved ball toter spent the week-end in the hospital, and it is probable that at least two of the four may not see action. The condition of Harold Van Every, triple threat ace, was worse, and he is likely to be out the rest of the season. Unencouraged by Gopher casualties, Coach Mai Elward said, “Whenever k ball carrier is injured, Minnesota has a habit of bobbing up with a new back who frequently is more dangerous than the injured man.”
V
Humphreys Returns Co-captain Paul Humphreys, who was injured in the Detroit game, made a brief appearance in the lineup yesterday, and Elward said that he may be able to use him at center. Since effective punting may be one method of keeping the Gophers out of Purdue territory, potential kickers were given ample time to perfect their form, with Jim Nesbitt, Lou Brock, and Jack Brown furnishing long boots consistently.

By Bruce Witwer Football prospects for next year are tooiking mighty bright these days . . . this is hardly the time to be thinking about next year when this season has only begun, but there is some luscious food for thought in pondering on the matter. —^fc— The fact which brought on the idea is that there are only three seniors in Purdue’s starting lineup against Detroit in the opening game ... Co-captains Paul Humphrey and Joe Mihal in the line, and Tony Ippolito in the fullback position . . . it all goes to show that the juniors and the sophomores are figuring largely in the performances which the Boilermakers turn in this year. —^fc— For a time it looked as if the starting seniors this week would be cut down by Humphrey’s absence due to a chipped bone in his wrist . . . after taking the cast off Monday, however, it is now a sure thing that he will have this last chance to get a crack at the Minnesota squad. —^fc— Revenge is always a motive for sports writers to write about in great lengths in regards to football games . . . “Sweet revenge and “blessed vengeance” . . . nice little phrases and especially applicable to the Minnesota game this week-end ... this will be Purdue’s tenth game with the Gophers . . . the record so far reads Purdue: won 3, lost 5, and tied one . . . that puts the Riveters behind the eight ball and more anxious to start evening up the count.
Burnham Warns Freshman Team “This year’s freshmen are not turning out for football practice as regularly as they have in past years. If this continues we will be forced to take up their uniforms.” Thus summarized Elmer Burnham, freshman football coach, concerning s^thletes who turn out for a sport and then fail to report to practice consistently. Burnham said previous practices have consisted of running through plaj« with a few scrimmages with the varsity. After this week the yearlings will switch over to learn Iowa and Ohio State plays. Color Teams The remainder of the squad has been divided up into four “color” teams, red, green, gold, and bla^k. The squads will play games against each other in practice, which furnishes the coaching staff an opportunity to notice and point out errors. In addition to the regular coaching staff, ^ob Michael, Sam Lyboult, Art Greey, Ted Jackson, and Norm Wooley, uppperclassmen in the school of physical education, are assisting in coaching the groups.
The last game, two years ago, saw a Purdue team which was rated one of the tops in the Big Ten fall before the Minnesota steam roller . . . this year’s squad has shown a plenty of ability so far and should be able to turn the trick if the old ada^e of “You can’t beat Mimtesow” isn’t too firmly embedded into the senses of everyone concerned. . . . speed against power . . . which will win..

New Yorkers Pound Out Timely Hits To Win Opener, 3-1; Dickey Raps Out Four Singles To lead Winners' Attack Wrigley FielcJ, Chicago—Power at the plate plus the artful hurling of Red Ruffing enabled the New York Yankees to administer a smarting 3-1 defeat to the Chicago Cubs in the initial contest of the 1938 World Series before 44,000 disheart-
ened fans here yesterday. Both clubs were hampered defensively by a stiff wind blowing from left field to right which managed to blow a couple of Tejfas league hits away from scampering infielders and Hartnett’s long triple away
from Henrich.
Smart Fielding
The smartest fielding exhibition ever shown by two world series game was exhibited by both nines, as batters were tossed out time after time or retired by great catches. The longest hit of the day was Hartnett’s triple, but the plate work of big Bill Dickey, the world champions’ ^eavy hitting catcher, captured the spotlight of the day, as he had a perfect day at bat, getting
four for four.
Yanks drew first blood when in the second inning they combined two hits, a Cub error, and a walk to push two runs across the rubber.' After one out, Gehrig walked on four pitches, and took third on Dickey’s place hit to right, Dickey, taking second on Cavaretta’s futile throw to third to get Gehrig.
Cubs Fumble
George Selkirk’s easy roller was fumbled by the Cub captain, Billy Herman, Gehrig scoring and Dickey reaching third. Flash' Gordon, the New Yorker’s freshman second baseman, then drove a ground ball through Stan Hack’s legs enabling Dickey to count. Ruffing ended the scoring by hitting into a double play, Jurges to Herman to Collins. The host club fought back in their

Billy Herman’s line drive couldn’t be held by Red Rolfe, and Hack tried for the plate, but was out on a throw from Crosetti to Dickey, Crosetti having backed up Rolfe after he had dropped Herman’s liner. Yanks scored again in the sixth after Henrich had doubled and Dickey’s high fly was caught by the wind, dropping for a hit while the entire Cub left defense chased it. Tony Lazzeri, a former Yank, proved that he knew a few of the Yank weaknesses when in the sixth he called Hack to the dugout to tell him the type of pitch to give Gehrig at that time batting wnth the count three and two on him and Henrich perched on second base. Hack relayed the message to Lee, and Gehrig went dovTi swinging on the next pitch.
