Parade of Opinion I by Associated Collegiate Press
• To Pay Or Not To Pay Although the 1939-40 football year ended in a blaze of bowl battles that drew more cash customers than ever before, the season just closed will not be famous for its spectacular plays or players. Eather it will go down in the record books as the year of the big unfinished debate: To pay or not to pay ? Spotlighted into national prominence by the dramatic decision of the University of Chicago to discontinue intercollegiatp football, the old question of subsidization of gridiron players was more vigorously discussed and more definitely acted upon than any other year since the advent of bigtime, highly-publicized pigskin encounters. Chicago Started It It all began with the disastrous point-a-minute losses of the Chicago team, a team that took beating after beating in Big Ten competition, much to the chagrin of Maroon fans. The fans, aided and abetted by sports writers in all sections of the nation, began the clamour for alumni funds to aid in securing hot-shot gridmen. Then came the bombshell announcement of the Chicago board of trustees, which said in part: “The university believes in athletics and in a comprehensive program of physical education for all students. It believes its particular interests and conditions are such that its students now derive no special benefit from intercollegiate football. The university looks upon all sports as games which are conducted under its auspices for the recreation of the students. The university will continue to promote intramural sports and will encourage all students to participate in them.” With this announcement, Chicago authorities cancelled all football games scheduled for the future and asked Big Ten authorities to allow it to continue intercollegiate participation in the 11 other sports sponsored by it. It is expected that the Big Ten’s answer to the Chicago proposal will be made in the near future. Loyola Too Meanwhile, with less fanfare and less comment from the columning quarterbacks, Loyola University of New Orleans calmly announced that it is discontinuing intercollegiate football so that the “large sums of money spent annually on football can be spent on educational expansion. On other fronts, too, subsidization was a large topic of discussion. At a meeting of the College Physical Education Association, Prof. L. C. Boles of College of Wooster urged his colleagues not to allow collegiate physical education to become a field for men of “very limited mental capacity” to continue in college for the sole purpose of plasung on teams. However, simon-pure football is not receiving the support of all students, for at many colleges undergraduates have begun movements to subsidize players so that losing streaks may be stopped. At the University of Buffalo, the student newspaper asked the college to give ten tuition scholarships a year to men who would be the nucleus for winning grid teams. At the University of Rochester, Pres. Alan Valentine rejected students demands for paid players. * Prom the Defense Hqre’s the way one coach defended the plan; “We’re just doing business above board. They do it everywhere—^this practice of taking care of athletes—^but they do it under cover. Down here we tell the boy what he can expect if he comes to one of our schools, and he gets it. Elsewhere, they get the boys jobs, sometimes paying them fabulous salaries for doing nothing. They call themselves simon-pure and look down upon our institutions. I can’t see it.”

26th Road School Opens For Week^ 350 Register “Primary responsibility of the State Highway Commission in the operation of the state highway and maintenance is to the motorist, the man who pays for all construction and maintenance of the state highway system today,” was the declaration made by Commissioner Howard Atcheson, Scottsburg, in his address yesterday afternoon before the opening general session of the twenty-sixth annual Road School being held at the University this week.
... is this cartoon reprinted from “Exponent’s” file of woodcuts. In the words of Browning, when this cut was made only the artist and God knew what it meant. — Now, who in the knows! May we offer our own interpretation? The central figure is an instructor and the four figures grouped around him are students (?). The two in the rear have received their final semester grade and the two in front have not. Any resemblance to persons passing—or flunking—examinations is purely coincidental... AND UNINTENTIONAL. Ender's Experiences Indicate A Class You Won't Care To Cut
By L. W. Archibald Gordon B. Enders, who is here to teach a history Qourse in Far Eastern Problems, is both mortal and immortal, if the congressional acts of the Tibetan National Assembly mean anything. Without a doubt he is a mortal, having been bom in Iowa some forty-seven years ago. And by the law of the “Hermit Kingdom” of Tibet, he is a Tibetan nobleman with a passport to heaven. Even as a mere four-year-old he couldn’t be held down, and ended up on the Indian frontier of Tibet. His first education was received some
13,000 miles from his native land, and the customs and language of Tibet were deeply imbedded when he returned to the University of Pittsburgh for a bit of college education. Life of Travel From this point life was another book of travel experiences, all of them away from the United States. World War aviator, flying instructor in China, and advisor to the Grand Panchan Lama of Tibet took up over fifteen years of the adventure story. (Continued on page 2)
Little Jack Jittle To Preside Over Interfrat Ball The gloom of finals lifted last night long enough to permit the Inter-Fraternity council to announce the date and band for their annual formal. Little Jack Little, the little swing man of music, has been chosen to play for the ball, which will be held Friday night, February 9. Attendance at the dance will be limited to 400 couples and will be held in one half of the Union ballroom. Bids for the affair are priced at two dollars and may be obtained at any of the fraternities. At last year’s ball, which attracted nearly 400 couples, Charlie Agnew and his band furnished the music. Decorations for this year’s affair will follow the general theme of last year’s adornments, which consisted of a large backdrop containing the Torch of Knowledge on the left side and the Skull on the right. The crests of the fraternities covered the walls. Dr. R. R. Wicks . . . dean of the Princeton University chapel, addressed a near capacity crowd at the January convocation for worship held Sunday morning in Eliza Fowler Hall. Dean Wicks, who is widely known as a pastor, educator, lecturer, and author, spoke on “The Great Conspiracy Against Force.” He has held his present position since 1929 and IS a member of the board of directors of the Union- Theological Seminary.
Officials expect the registration which numbers 350 at present to run approximately 1,000 before the week is over. City, county, and state officials, contractors, material and equipment men, and others interested in the street and highway problem are here for the conference that is to last through Pnday of this week. Equipment Display Many thousands of dollars worth of equipment will be on display in the armory tomorrow evening and Thursday in conjunction with the road school. The public is invited to attend and see this large group of road equipment. Other Speakers Other talks made during the session were by G. R. Harr, associate highway engineer of the Public Roads Administration, Marc G. Waggeners, director of publicity of the state commission, and discussions were later led concerning these men’s talks by Ivan Graggs, Johnson County surveyor and T. R. Johnston, University publicity director, “When you realize that during the past year $1,765,656.72 of the state highway funds were expended on construction and maintenance of the 410 miles of state highway routes through these cities, I am sure you can appreciate how the financial responsibilities imposed by the general assembly are being met by the commission,” he said in conclusion. “During the past fiscal year the state highway commission spent $415,039.32 in maintenance of the 410 miles of state highway routes in 79 cities having a population of more than 3,500,” was the statement made by Atchenson in his opening address.

How are you doin’ Or would you rather just not talk about the whole business. The library is getting a little stuffy these days after about two weeks of continuous occupation. And the money that has been lost by flipping coins to make decisions on true and false tests. Such economic waste. Personally, we’re agin’ these finals on about every count possible. —H & H— Fancy our having such musician top notchers as Tiny Hill, Little Jack Little and Tommy Dorsey playing here during the month of February. Yet that’s the way the schedule looks now. Tiny Hill will play for the Phi Kappa, Phi Kappa Tau, and Kappa Delta Rho triad dance on Friday, February 2. The following Friday night, February 9, Little Jack Little is to be in the ballroom presiding over the annual Interfraternity Ball. —H & H— Tommy Dorsey’s coming for the opening of the Union on Wednesday night, January 31, is one of the biggest surprise items of the semester. That’s really the way to end an old semester, we think. Just dance away all the C’s (or reasonably accurate facsimile thereof) to the tune of “Getting Sentimental Over You.” —H&H—
The thing that is. bothering us is this business of dedicating the new ballroom. Don’t you think it should be done properly with champagne and stuff. Then who gets to break the champagne bottle if such a ceremony is held. We could probably dream up a nice little affair for that opening. —H&H—
Just to pass away the time, since exams leave so much leisure to be spent, we took a quick fun over to the movies the other night. Result ? Just can’t-understand why all the good movies have to be held at the certain movie house where the pop corn popper makes so darn much noise. It’s really a serious matter. The sound effects of the movie house are certainly added to immensely by that constant “pop pop” in the lobby. Then too, we wonder if some device couldn’t be devised to get people in and out of their seats without disrupting the entire section of the theatre. One aisle just isn’t enough for a theatre we’ve decided, but it’s good exercise getting up and down. They really have the good movies though.

Enders Experiences (Continued from page 1)
Many foreigners have been through China and Japan; few have penetrated to the heart of Siberia. One or two have visited the “Hermit Kingdom,” but only Enders has lived there and worked among these people who swab themselves in yaak butter to protect their bodies from the cold. Enders served on the cabinet of the Grand Lama, and held a seat in the Upper Assembly. . Grand Lama “The Lama was a great fellow,” Enders told us. He is regarded by his people as God On Earth, Incarnate. He attends all high social functions, but by all except two or three of his inner circle, is never known to partake of food. “But I’ve seen have take a little tea and toast in private. Why, when he visited on the Sacramento, I got him into my cabin and we had a little ice cream. He thinks it’s a dessert fit for gods,” Advisor Advisor to Chiang-Kai-Shek for ; two years, Enders gained an insight into the troubles of the Chinese people. He saw the Japanese forces attack Shanghai twice, and has visited in both the cartips of the Chinese and the Japanese. Once he had a little trouble in understanding one of the Chinese customs. A miserly pilferer was stretched before some bamboo poles, gasping continually. He entreated Ms guide to explain why such brutal treatment was being 'administered. “You see, I didn’t realize it, but the Chinese are a very objectiveminded people. The criminal had such a long record that he had been force-fed two and one-half pounds • of salt. This eats out the stomach • diaphragm, causing him to gasp heavily. If he ever lived through the punishment, he couldn’t steal without being heard.” Difficult Language “The Chinese, from centuries ago, developed their language to make it difficult for foreigners to intervene. There are few different sounds basically, but each of the vowel sounds has four inflections. Cantonese cannot understand the dialect of another group 80 miles away. But the written characters are logically quite similar.” “The Chinese symbol for ‘peace’ is a roof with a 'vvoman under it. For ‘war’ there is a roof with two women under it. And a roof with three women beneath it means ‘gossip’,’’Enders laughed. The Course The history course which has been proposed is called “America’s Role in the Pacific.” “But it won’t be quite as formal as that,” Enders told us. “We’ll probably lecture a little while on the stepup of the Orient, tie up a few news headlines with our understanding of the East, and maybe get over into Russia. If a controversial headline comes up involving the Orient, a class debate may be worthwhile.” Well, debates or no debates, the course ought to be something. And we’ll wager it Won’t be hard to at-‘ tend class regularly, after once having heard and talked with the lecturer—a Tibetan nobleman.

Now that a super-smooth orchestra has finally l^en booked for tbe new Union hkllrbom gening, the feminine contingent of the University is in an uproar. The query on every co-ed’s lips is: “Do you have at date to T. Dorsey?” and the wish in every heart is “Please God.... let me have a date to T. Dorsey.” Get on the ball, you eds.... —CO— ■ With Spring jiist abound the corner fashions come foremost in every girl’s mind. Have you seen any of those luscious open mid-ruff formals ? Long tweed jackets are just the thing to wear over pleated skirts during the tedious hours spent in the armory while registering. Ultra-tailored outfits dear to the heart of every college girl are being shown in every color and style.
We wonder if an article similar to a Michigan co-ed’s called “80 Reasons Why I Hate Men” would cause as much of a furor on our campus as it did on Michigan’s. Since Marion Phillips wrote this article, she has been one ,of the most dated co-eds on Michigan’s campus.
When next semester rolls around, there will be a vacancy in the freshman chemistry department due to the impending marriage of Miss Florence Clarke, , instructor. May the future always be a bright one, Miss Clarke; we’ll all miss you.
—CO— In just a few days finals will be a memory—fond for some,. otherwise for others—and we’ll all catch the next train home to have a little fun and stuff. Then, back to school to catch up on our sleep, do a little registering, and settle down to the old routine once more. See you all at registration.

By Regina Baker
Many plans for the second semester activities have been made by members of the WAA council. Heading the list is the WAA Intramural Swimming meet to be held February 13 in the Women’s Gymnasium. All co-eds are invited to enter in any of the numerous events offered On the program. In order for a co-ed to be eligible for entry, three, half-hour practices are required. These practice swims may be made any afternoon except Saturday and Sunday from 4 to 6 o’clock.
Plans for the Penny Carnival on March 9 are in the infant stage; all co-ed groups are urged to enter their booths. The carnival is sponsored annually by the Sportswomen and women’s athletic groups. Prizes for the most original booth and the exhibition making the most money will be awarded.
Ping pong, shufflejboard, and basketball are also on the calendar for the February sports.
The second semester membership drive will be under way at registration. The memberships are priced at a dollar each. Come on, co-eds, let’s support a real all-women’s activity !

Ag Short Course Enrollees Launch
With a widely varied program of athletics aliped for them, the ag short course students will convene B^riday night, January 26, at 7 p. m. in the fieldhouse for their first nigl|it of organized play. The number of boys included in the program, which is headed by Larry Imhoff, totals 154. Seven Sports •■ - . c
Any of seven sports may be chosen for the next seven weeks by the short course students. The student .may choose from basketball, swimming, v o 1 l^e y - b' a 11, boxing, wrestling, ping-pong, and rifle. .4^11 of these sports will be conducted at the same time, making it impossible for an individual to compete in more than one of them. However, at other times during the week, all facilities in the fieldhouse are available for the eight-weekers.
Doc Miller Examiner
Every prospective short course athlete must report at the fieldhouse Coach Allspaw Calls All Golf Candidates Coach Harry Allspaw has announced that varsity golf candidates should report at the fieldhouse Thursday, February 1. Freshmen candidates are asked to report the following day. Allspaw, entering his second year as Boilermaker golf mentor, is anxious to get off to a good start toward building a formidableifoe to the other Big Ten
golf squads.
Free instruction will be given by Coach Allspaw to all golf candidates from 2 till 6 p. m, on week days. The instruction will be given in the basement of the Fieldhouse. The golf-driving range and putting range are available at all times for both candidates and non-candidates. Equipment is supplied from the check-out window.

ior year.
Bgilermakets Lead All-Time Standings For^ig Ten Basketball Competition No matter how you look at it .Pjirdue is at the top of t]he Big Ten as far as basketball is concerned. Ope glance at the sttmdf* ings for the present year will assure us that the present ]^iiermaker netmen are in the top spot, and another glance into the records show^ that it has been that way on numerous other occasions.
Mike Sofiak (left) and Jim Rae (right) who are spearheads in the powerful Wolverine attack. Michigan is deadlocked with Indiana for run-ner-up honors in the Big Ten race with three wins and one setback. The lone meeting of Michigan and the Boilermakers is scheduled at Ann Arbor. Request Performance Of Aquacade Will Be Presented At Road Shbw Tomorrow Dick Papenguth and his “Aquacade Varieties” are preparing to reappear in the fieldhouse tomorrow nigh|;, this time at the request of members of the annual road school which is convening here this week. Students, however, will be missing from the audience as only the road men willl)e admitted. A full program has been planned
for the show with all the stars of the last meet participating with the exception of comedian Larry Griswold who is forced to stay in Florida (the lucky guy, we wish we were there).

For performances on the diving board there will be Barbara Cook, aided by Herber, Briggs, and Fahrner. Barbara is a senior and has been doing some top flight performing in the four years she has been here. Speed To Burn For those who like speed there will be Patty Aspinal, Adolf Kiefer, and a full squad of Boilermaker swimmers and there will be a hardy attack on state and national swimming records. Patty, only thirteen years old, will be making an assault of the record for the 300 yard meter breast stroke which is held now by Catherine Rawls. In her last visit here she was able to tie the existing national women’s record. New World’s Record? Kiefer will be racing against time in an effort to set a new world’s record in the backstroke and from , all indications there is a good chance that he may succeed tomorrow.

Tliat “Purdue’s new leading basketball team is an outstanding example of games won through putting proper emphasis on the team and not upon individual star” was very pleasantly written recently by an editorial writer on Lafayette’s Journal and Courier and so we pass it on to our readers today. —^fc— “The men who get the ball, the men who pass expertly to the bas-ket-shooters; the men who put on speed and more and more speed as the game gets hot; the men who have the condition and the stamina to set a finishing pace which the opposition cannot survive — such are the factors in Purdue’s steady climb to the top,” the writer continues. —fc— “Whatever happens during the remainder of the season, tribute is being paid on all sides to the balanced scoring, the undauntable offensive and the skilled defense displayed by every member of the Purdue squad of belligerent but not boastful Boilermakers,” the writer concluded. —fc— ’Nuff sed! —^fc— INFO . . . . . . the Boilermaker basketball squad has the best one-game record this year for successful free throws, 14 out of 17, which was made against the Northwestern Wildcats in the Big Ten season opener for the locals. —^fc— Incidentally, the Boilermakers are in second place—relative to recording the best mark from the charity line. . .. They have made 46 successful free throws and 29 misses. . . . Ohio State is in first place in this department,/with 38 out of a possible 57 in the first four games. —^fc— Minnesota, Illinois and Northwestern all have missed more than they made in the free-throw department.

Gold and Black netmen have won a total of 248 conference victories since 1907 and lead Wisconsin, holders of second place, in the total league standings by a 3-game margin. Third in the standings for all games is our old rival from Illinois, while Michigan comes close behind them. Indiana’s record shows that the Hoosiers have a total of 163 victories and 194 defeats and are just out of the first division in sixth place. The standings in total games since 1907: Won Lost Pet. Purdue 248 145 !631 Wisconsin 245 158 .608 Michigan 144 117 .552 Minnesota 195 210 .481 Indiana 163 194 .467 Ohio State 137 172 .447 Chicago 184 236 .438 Northwestern 150 209 .418 Iowa 125 202 .382 In this period of time the Boilermakers have come out on top twelve times, six times with clear titles, and six in ties with other schools. Ten of these, however, have come under the regime of “Piggy” Lambert and represent one of the most impressive coaching records in basketball today. Like First Division Only once, his first year here, have the Bpilermakers been out of the first division since Lambert took over the reins and began turning out winners back in 1917. Twice since then his teams have been fifth, four times they copped fourth place and the remaining times the team has ended up in first or second place. A look at the winners of the individual scoring titles will also tell the same story, for exactly half of the leading scorers in the last fourteen seasons have worn the Gold and Black and the impressive records sqt by Jewell Young, for a season’s play, and for three years of competition look as though they will stand the onslaught of other scoring stars for a long time. »Boilermakers Dominate Since the adoption of the semirotating schedule in 1924 the Boilermaker’s domination has been even more noticeable.,Indiana is holding the runners-up position in this standing and ey^n if they won all their games and Purdue lost all theirs, not a very likely situation we might mention, it would take the Hoosiers until March, 1943, to overtake the Riveters. One of the most noticeable things about this standing is that with just one exception it matches the conference standings as they are in the present season. Moving Miimesota above the Wisconsin crew would bring this standing right up to date. Indiana Coming Up A comparison of these two standings, sipce 1924, and since 1907 reveal only one very startling change. Indiana has come from sixth to second while Wisconsin, second in the total standing has not done so well in recent years and is in seventh place in the later standings. We might also add that Chicago has only won 6 of 52 games in the last five years. This, however, reminds and gives us reason to believe that we looked, just a little too far into the statistics and that we had better qmt before we run across any more embarrassing facts. The standings for the last sixteen years since the present system of scheduling games was introduced:

Who Teaches What
A veil of mystery seems to hang over portions of the Schedule of Classes for next semester. Students planning to take some courses which are oifered in many sections are unable to find out just what instructor will teach what section at what hours. The name of the professor in general charge appears in the booklet, but names of individual class instructors in some instances are not given. Information concerning just who is to teach each section may be placed before the student at registration tables, but last-minute shuffling seems to prevent accurate listing beforehand. This is especially true in courses which have attendant laboratory periods, as chemistry and electrical engineering. If names of section instructors in these courses were announced before registration, late changes might alter the annouriced schedule completely. Where the actual class hours would not be changed, the shifting of one instructor might require the shifting of several more. This was explained to us by one of the professors in charge. Naming of specific instructors for each section, even if several are scheduled at the same hour, is done, however, in applied mechanics, mathematics, English, physics, and most of the non-laboratory courses. This idea would seem to promote Good Teaching more than the stab-in-the-dark method of scheduling classes and instructors. For, by the campus grapevine, students usually learn just who the best teachers are, and their sections always close first. This should serve as an incentive for other instructors to

The Purdue honor system goes over great according to all the students we’ve queried. When you get properly situated in E E 129, you can just barely discern the fellow nearest you. On a clear day. During our last test a fog rolled in from the direction of the Shops and we were cut off from civilitiation for 45 minutes.
better their own methods of teaching technique. It has the disadvantage that students who register last may find their desired section closed, but this seems to be a lesser evil. Rapid filling-up of a certain section and slowfilling of another section cannot always be taken as a measure of the instructor’s ability. Schedule difficulties, known to every student, will come into play, and hardly any student wants to schedule Saturday morning classes unless it is absolutely necessary. Something is surely indicated, however, when a marked difference is apparent among numbers of students enrolled in various sections at the same hour, if the instructors are known. The student may not always select the best teacher, but ordinarily Good Teaching closely parallels student enthusiasm, unless the particular instructor is a notoriously high or low grader. We are not well enough acquainted with the problems of instructors in scheduling classes to suggest a way to announce the section instructors names before registration, and we realize that sometimes it would be very difficult to do so. But we do believe that, where it is at all possible,^ the student, as the willing and hopeful purchaser of education, should have the wares clearly set forth in the academic showcase.
Briefs
by Clarence
the Boetnose
Says-
Joyfully today Clarence tells a story. It seems that last year a student took a course of study at Purdue in which he wrote, handed in, and got back a paper. We shall hereafter refer to this paper that was written as “Manuscript A.”
Clarence copied this manuscript onto another sheet of form paper and handed it in this year.
Dear Bull Session; Something’s wrong. Clarence got a grade one letter higher than the last year’s student.
We pause here just long enough to toss a ripe tomatoe at the student who handed the paper in the first time. Evidently he didn’t know how to do it.
Confidentially, Clarence always curtsies low on one knee, and doflfs his hat while handing in papers of this type. They are placed on the desk weighted down by a red, polished, apple.
We all do a lot of hollering about finals, but when it comes down to a last analysis they’re not so bad after all. For instance if you’re exempt its all veiy nice, while the rest of the campus gets unnecessarily hot and bothered you have time to relax and enjoy yourself. Then on the other hand if you’ve been loafing all seipester and are flunking right along, they’re the one last chance. If you lose, so what, you’re no worse off than before. The only boy that got any kick coming are the in-betweeners. And so what, if you’ve been plugging along all semester, chances are you know the course and a little review never hurt anyone. The way I look at it finals just stack up to more sleep and less time in school. What I mean is after all what the hell’s the difference, 99 times out of a 100 you’re better off taking them; unless, of course, you’re the hundredth man.
On one day this week, Clarence took a final in which the room was too crowded, so our hero, together with several other fellows, were send down the hall to a different room. IN THAT ROOM CO-EDS WERE TAKING A PINAL.
Dear Bull Session: Some of the girls were looking at the other girl’s papers while the exam was in progi’ess. I can’t say any more without involving the actual persons. They’re dishonest!
We got along all right.

The stuff we print is lot. The paper is as peppery as a cemetary lot. The rag shows rotten management. The jokes, they say, are stale. The upperclassmen holler. The lower classmen rail. But when the paper’s issued, (We say it with a smile) If'some one doesn’t get one. You can hear him yell a mile. —B & B— We measured it. —B & B— Well you asked for it, no contribs, no dirt.
