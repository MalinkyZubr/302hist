Eight Hundred Grads Here For Gala Week Festivities Founder's Day Banquet 'Old Timers' Report
Highlights Celebrations “This is a sentimental occasion, and the University rejoices to have you come back and see our achievements,” President E. C. Elliott said last night in extending yrelcome to the alumni at the annual Founder’s Day banquet, one of the outstanding features of the Gala Week program. Eight hundred and thirty-one loyal graduates and former students have gathered on the campus to participate in the week-end celebrations, which yesterday entered their second day. Yesterday alumni were busy, not only vdth their class reunions, but also with a series of events starting early in the morning and continuing until late at night. As usual the Union building served as the center of activities and class gatherings. In the Union halls. University buildings, and on campus walks thronged the graduates, eager to visit their former haunts, and inspect the new classroom equipment. Founder’s Day Highlight of yesterday’s activities was the Founder’s Day banquet in the Union ballrooms. The banquet program was opened by Paul Whiteman, who first introduced the members of his band. Henry Roberts, ’12, serving as toastmaster, presented several prominent alumni, after which brief speeches were given by Dr. Henry Hass, head of the school of chemistry, representing the faculty; David Ross, president of the Board of Trustees, representing the trustees; Lawrence Archibald, chairman of the Gala Week committee, representing the seniors; and President Elliott. Although neither was able to attend, Dr. Charles Russ Richards, president emeritus of Lehigh University, and Bruce Rogers, noted type and book designer, wei e named the recipients of the Distinguished (Continued on page 4)
UniversitY Greatly Changed Since '90's By Jim Purcell The long corridor of the Union, known and paraded so often by the classes of ’43, ’42, ’41 and ’40 in the day-by-day hustle and bustle of University life, came in for its share of glory yesterday afternoon when the “old timers” of classes ranging from ’78 to ’99 gathered there to hold necessarily short, but hearty “sessions” about “the good ole days.” \ George Ade, ’87, one of the University’s most prominent graduates, in answer to our stock set of questions said that the University has changed to the extent that when he entered in the fall of ’83 things were at a low ebb, with one president leaving and another arriving. Now “Purdue is stupendous,” Mr. Ade said, and went on to mention the new Hall of Music. Changes Not Sudden Mr. Ade has lived in Brook, about 50 miles from the campus, since 1905, and so, as he says, the changes in the University have not been as sudden and as overpowering to him as they must be to some of the other older graduates who have not been able to visit the campus during the past years. Mr. Ade remarked that he and Dave Ross, who with him had bought land and promoted the building of Ross-Ade Stadium, were really being selfish in naming the stadium Ross-Ade. Mr. Ade defended his socalled “selfishness” by saying that both he and Ross were old bachelors and felt that this was the only way they would be remembered. He said that he had felt that the stadium should be named after all the rest of the persons who made it possible as well. Mr. Ade continued, “The Purdue (Continued on page 4)
A Week ©f War By J. H. McKee Allied Expeditionary Forces Left Central Norway . . . Thursday evening, leaving the small army of Norway, with ammunition enough for one day remaining, to cope with the invading German forces. Germany now is in almost complete control of Norway south of the Arctic Circle. Colonel Getz, acting commander of the Norwegian army in and around Trondheim, asked German officials for an armistice for the entire Trondheim sector. He did not, though, ask for an armistice for the entire country. Getz placed full blame for the partial capitulation on the Allies. “The British and French—for reasons unknown to us— have given up helping us in our fight and have withdrawn their troops from Namos and Andalsnes. We stand alone against the entire German war machine . . . Any further fighting would lead only to destruction without serving any military purpose,” Getz said in his report to his officers.
Tuesday British . . . sources announced that fresh tioops had been landed both north and south of Trondheim and that they were being rushed to the defense of the central Norwegian railway, Dombaas-Stoeren. It was reported that German troops driving toward the railway were stopped short of their objective by Allied troops already there. Of the Allied positions at Trondheim they said, “Our position north of the city has been vastly improved.” The Following Day . . . British military circles speculated as to whether the Allied expeditionary forces in central NorAvay would be able to make a “successful last ditch stand” and maintain their military foothold in that .section, and also protect their positions to the south near Trolndheim. Reports That German . . . troops were hammering the Allied forces in the Dombaas sector Avere made Wednesday. The British admitted that they had withdrawn toward the east coastline, but did not say that the Dombaas area had been abandoned. The official communique Wednesday night said, “In the Dombaas area south of Trondheim, our troops, after stubborn resistance in the face of strong enemy attacks, withdrew to prepare positions.”

Thus The Announcement ... by Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain Thursday of the withdrawal of Allied troops came as a surprise not only to Britishers but Norwegians. At the time the British troops withdrew, news reporters reported that the Norwegian troops had resumed the fight in southern and central Norway with renewed morale. Britain Scuttled . . . her first vessel last week following a German air raid. The ship was the 1,190-ton escort vessel Bittern. The naval announcement said, “The Bittern was sunk by our own forces to avoid danger to navigation after she was fired by enemy bombers.” One of the Geiman attackers was reported “shot down in flames,” The Million Dollar . . . offer of Samuel Harden Church, president of the Carnegie Institute, for the delivery of Adolf Hitler to the League of Nations was met by mixed cheers and jeers. Legal minded Americans pondered as to whether an American attempt to claim the reward would be a violation of the United States neutrality act. One young eastern student immediately wired a pledge of ten thousand dollars for delivery of Chamberlain or Reynaud “dead or alive.”
Jepson, Martini Present ^ond Dedi^ion Concert Capacity Audience Views ^ Final Dedicatory Service Last night the University put on its “Sunday best” and showed to the alumni and the world at large its newest addition to the campus. Having dedicated it Friday night in the presence of the student body. President Elliott directed the dedication of the huge edifice in the presence of some six thousand guests who gathered for the ceremony and the dual concert afterwards by Helen Jepson and Nino Martini. Included also in last night’s dedicatory ceremonies were the invocation by the Rev. R. F. Thornton, and brief addresses by Lieut. Gov. Henry F. Schricker and John M. Carmody, administrator of the Federal Works Agency. Carmody spoke by direct wire from Washington, D. C. Lieut. Gov. Schricker, praising President Elliott for his part in making the building possible, pointed out that here in America “our program is to sustain life and give it its fullest meaning while in Europe they are tearing down civilization.” He also pointed out the money spent on Music Hall would only build one battleship or three large bombing planes. Walter P. Scholer, architect for the building was introduced by Dr. Elliott and gratefully acknowledged the applause of the audience. Federal Works Administrator Carmody conveyed President Roosevelt’s regrets that he could not be there and spoke of the Music Hall as a “monument of culture.” The program included selections by the military band, the concert choir and the glee club who performed during the first half of the dedication. Miss Jepson and Martini proved to be as popular last night with the off-campus crowd as they did with Friday night’s student audience. Both received several encores during their eight part concert.

Bjr Bobart J. Decluurd “DOUBLE-SHUFFLE” “The .most phenomenal driver in all golfing history is Jimmy Thomson,” claimed Edward Burke, Chicago, to us over lunch in the Windy City Thursday last. —fc— “That fellow can drive a ball farther with a midiron than the average golfer can with a driver .. . He can smack it farther with a driver than any golfer who ever lived . . . His drives seldom fail to go less than 300 yards when an occasion demands such a drive.” —^fc— And Burke should know of which he is speaking . . . When manager of the Broadmoor Hotel, Colorado Springs, during the late ’20’s, Burke, who is a golfing enthusiast de luxe, employed Thomson as a caddy and later made this sterling ball-smack-er a pro at the Broadmoor golf course. —^fc— For hours, that boy, for Jimmy w as then a boy who now has become noted as the longest driver in the world, perfected his form, in the meantime, endeavoring to send some mighty distance ... At that time, the ball was sailing away consistently for 300 yards, Burke added. —fc— We asked Burke, who has followed and promoted Jimmy throughout his golfing career which is far froin being at an end, why this aikist' was able to pole away so remarkably. “He’s built for driving,” he answered. “You don’t find any knotty muscles on that boy,. . . All linear. . . . Weighs only 176 pounds and has a nice pair of shoulders that, goes along nicely with his driving.” —^fc— “But most of’ his power comes from those mammoth wrists of his,” Burke told us. “They’re about twice the size of the average man’s . . . I’ve never seen such wrist action, which he calls ‘double-shuifle.’ ' “When he starts his drive and
first swings with the club coming from behind his shoulders, there is snap of the wrists, and, just at the time the head of the club makes contact with the ball, there is another snap of the wrists . . . He seems to get more drive from his ‘double-shuffle,’ which took a long time to perfect.” —fo— “The whole thing seems screwy to me, but, in my estimation, he’s the greatest long-distance driver that ever walked the face of the earth,” Burke concluded.

Bailey Allows3 Hits In Boilermaker TrackmenSwamp Opener; Ohio Wins Finale C/iicago/ScoreTAreeSfams
With Seymour Greenberg in their fold, the powerful racqueteers of Northwesterir annihilated the Riveters, 9-0 yesterday on the courts of the Pieldhouse. Besides being the Cat’s number one man, Greenberg is the National City Parks Champ--ion. Every Wildcat netter completely outclassed his foe by taking every match in two sets. Playing Fred Puente in his singles match, Greenberg turned back the Boilermaker captain with identical scores of 6-1. Teamed with Gerry Clifford, Seymour was instrumental in defeating the Riveter number one doubles combination of Fuente and Hebbeler.
■ When the fickle Hoosier weather man “turned the other cheek” yesterday, the Boilermaker baseball team took advantage of this temporary good fortune td sneak in a sizzling double-header with the invading Ohio State Buckeyes. Bob Bailey, ace moundsman of the Riveter squad, turned in a threehit performance in the initial game to turn back the Bucks, 4-2. Dornbrook of the Buckeyes more than matched Bailey as he %eld the Boilermakers to two hits and led the Ohio State team to a 3-1 victory in the nightcap.
On a soggy track, soaked by recent rains, the Boilermaker cinder squad nipped the Chicago Maroons in Ross-Ade Stadium yesterday by a 87-44 margin, although the Maroons were quite resistant in several
of the events.
Slams in the quarter-mile, 120 yard high hurdles, and the two-mile run counted heavily toward the Riv-
Wabash Next Thus far this season the Riveter squad has won three dual matches while losing four. Traveling to Wabash tomorrow to meet the Little Giants, the Riveters will /endeavor to get back in winning form. Returning home Tuesday the Boilermakers will play host to the Armour Tech netters in the afternoon. The summary is as follows, with the victorious Wildcat’s name appearing first: Greenberg defeated Fuente 6-1, 6-1; O’Neil won from Anderson 6-0, 7-5; Clifford beat Heihaus 6-0, 6-0; G. Richards triumphed over Lucht 6-2, 6-4; Hall turned back P. Richards 6-1, 6-4; Shapiro was victorious over Berg 6-4, 6-3; Greenberg and Clifford defeated Fuente and Hebbeler 6-1, 6-1; O’Neil and G. Richards won from Anderson and Lucht 6-3, 8-6; Hall and Shapiro beat Carlson and F. Richards 6-3, 6-3. ,
Bailey’s fast-breaking curve had the Buckeye batters fooled through the entire first game. Morgan hit to right field in the first inning but died on second. Kilmer, Ohio pitcher, laced a grounder through short to open the third inning but was stranded on first. Witter smashed out a long triple to start the Ohio seventh but also failed to score. Bailey fanned eight Buckeyes while walking six, but he was most effective with men on the bases. Twice Ohio State runners reached third base with but one out, only to see the next two batters strike out. Buckeyes Score The first Buckeye run came in the fourth inning when McLain received a pass, stole second, took third on an infield out, then scored on Sexton’s long fly. Waldo tallied the final Ohio run in the fifth. He reached first on Smithson’s error, took second on a passed ball, raced to third after Kilmer had filed oqjt to Vernon, then scored on a wild pitch by Bailey. The Riveters waited until the fourth before they set out to whittle down the Buck’s two run lead. McFerren opened the inning with a rousing double to left, went to third on a wild pitch, and scored after Vernon’s fly. Mackiewicz walked, then reached third on Waterhouse’s single to right. Mack completed the scoring for the inning as Ohio failed to catch Waterhouse on a double play attempt, but put Hearne out at first. Wargo struck out to end the inning. Smithson Scores Smithson beat out a bunt to start the seventh. Then, starting with the pitch, he raced all the way to third as the Buckeye third-sacker took Fisher’s perfect bunt and threw him out at first. Smithson put the Boilermakers in the leacf as he crossed the plate on a passed ball. Hearne walked with two away in the eighth, went to third on Wargo’s single and an error, and scored when
Kilmer walked Smithson and Fisher. Dornbrook Effective Dornbrook held the Riveters almost completely in check in the second game. After the Boilermakers had scored their lone run in the second inning, only five men reached first base and only one got any further. Dornbrook struck out six while walking two. Higgins pitched for the Riveters until he was relieved by Emmert and allowed six hits and struck out five.
Waterhouse singled to open the Boilermaker second. He raced all the way to third on Witter’s error and scored the only Riveter run as Smithson forced Hearne at second. McFerren singled for thte second and last Boilermaker hit in the third inning. Higgins Gets Into Trouble Although the Buckeyes hit four times in the first five innings, Higgins was able to hold them scoreless. The sixth was a different story. He had a little trouble controlling the ball and walked Morgan and Fraker to start the inning. All hands wei^e safe on McLain’s grounder and the bases were filled. Higgins then settled down and forced Nichols and Sexton to fly out to the infield. Witter slashed out a long triple past Vernon and drove in three runs to complete the scoring for the afternoon. Higgins set the Buckeyes down in order in the seventh and eighth innings, stopped a scoring attempt in the ninth, but even the head of the Boilermaker batting order was unable to solve Dornbrook’s pitching and the Buckeye’s held their lead. Today’s games give the Boilermakers a record of two wins against three losses in the conference race. Ohio State has won two and lost two.

eter’s top-heavy total, but the other events were hard-fought, and treated over 500 Gala Week visitors with a fine track exhibition. Holderman Stars Again Undefeated in the two races in which he entered, Ed Holderman, stellar Riveter middle-distance runner, shared the Boilermaker burden with Dave Rankin and Ted Tycocki. Holderman romped to the tape over 100 yards ahead of Chicago’s Lambert to win his first race, the mile run. In the half-mile event Allen Gaulke eased to the side of Holderman as they neared the finish, and the pair broke the tape together. Gridman Dave Rankin rated highscoring honors of the meet, accounting for 14 Riveter points, by winning two firsts, a tie for second, and two thirds. He lead the field to the tape in both the low and high hurdles, while gaining a tie for second in the high jump, and thirds in the shot put and discus. Tycocki Wins Two Ted Tycocki totaled 11 points for his moirqing’s work. Firsts in the broad jump and 220 yard run were his best achievements. His other source of points was from a third in the 100 yard dash, a race ending in a blanket finish. Capt. Shackleton sped the quarter-mile distance in one of his fastest times of the year, 60.3 seconds. That time is just .8 seconds slower than the Purdue record which he set last year. Lacking only six inches of humbling his old recOfd, Jake Weber heaved the shot over 48 feet, Weber also copped second place in t^ discus. In the two mile race Keitfi McLaughlin turned in a surprise performance by edging out Reeves after the two had been running neck and neck for almost the full distance. Vollmer was the other Purdue victor, winning the javelin throw.

While thumbing through an engineering specification book the other week we ran across a detailed account of “U. S. Government Master Specification for Rubber Hot Water Bottles.” Somehow it took all the glamour and element of chance out of the use of the Hot Water Bottle . . . brought everything down on a lower plane.

FINIS There comes a time in the life of all seniors when they should retire and coast until graduation. Then also, there comes a time for all things to come to a close. Therefore, we choose today as the day for bring-
ing to an end the first and last year of “But Incidentally.” The column, created early last fall, has been written as much for the fun of writing it as it was for publication. Intentions of the Russians, sometimes not very deary have been, in the past, mainly to poke fun at everyday surroundings, acquaintances, and acts. “But Incidentally” was founded on critical observation, our own brand of humor, and tons of pure whimsey. We sincerely hope that you who read the column have enjoyed it as much as we who wrote it. We wish to thank the various “guest’’ writers whose columns appeared frequently under our heading, and we hope that some successor will fill the space left vacant by the discontinuance of “But Incidentally.” Bill Dunshee, Petrov Bill Frederick, Vladimir Bob Insley, Romanoff Rath Squires, Serge —30—

At last we have the column again! The reabon for its failure to appear in the last three (or was it four) issues of the Exponent was: WE COULDN’T FIND THE B & B EDITOR! By chance we wandered into the Blazer and found Brownie trying to get him out of there—so here he is again. —B & B— Hello, students! We’ll start off today’s program with a little poem dedicated to the weather in Lafayette ... also a sequel to the one that was run before, ‘Spring has come, the grasses has riz . . . ’: “Little drops of water. Little flakes of snow. ' What I want to know is: Where in the heck did those May Flowers go?” —B & B— ■We have a new bureau, on the campus called the “Know-it-all.” Any problem, be it pertaining to love or study, can be answered. The specialists in this art are Dorothy Dix, Jane Jordan, and Madge Rogers. Just call 2243. (Paid Ad) —B & B— A break for the eds! Dear B & B: Do you approve of wolfing? YouTe probably prejudiced on matters, but it’s fun, no kiddin’. Sometimes necessary, too. For instance, the best girl friend, who is beautiful and charming, threatens to drop in on me one of these days. And me being interested in lessons, etc. have a depleted stock of boyj friends to dazzle her with. Must do something about such a state of affairs pronto. Betty Jane Short.
Alumni award by toastmaster Roberts. At 2 o’clock in the afternoon alumni gathered on the oval to place a wreath on John Purdue’s grave and raise the 1940 class flag, while PO MM members fired a 71 gun salute. Immediately following this impressive ceremony, members of the various graduated classes gathered for the traditional class parade. Led by the sole representative of the class of ’84, Harry Rank,, the grads marched behind the military band to Ross-Ade stadium. At the stadium visitors, students, and alumni watched next fall’s football players battle in an intra-squad game. Between halves, the outstanding freshman football player was presented with a watch, an alumni gift. Preceding the afternoon’s activities, approximately five-hundred alumni and their families gathered in the north Union ballroom for the Gala Week alumni luncheon, atwhich the,grads were seated by classes. Hank Miller introduced some of the prominent alumni over station WB AA. Following the luncheon short speeches were given by David Ross, pi'esident of the Board of Trustees; Frank Hockema, assistant to the president; George Ade, prominent alumnus; Dean Skinner, dean emeritus of the school of agriculture ; and John Coulter, nephew of Dr. Stanley Coulter. Adam Wallace, who entered the University with the first class in 1874 and graduated in 1878, was also introduced. At the business meeting after the luncheon of the Alumni Association three officers were reelected without opposition. They were David E. Ross for alumni trustee for another three years; Fred Schaff, ’07, New York industrialist, director for the Atlantic region; and Volney Lay, ’06, La-
Today Today’s activities, which will close the three-day Gala Week program, will open with breakfasts and class meetings at 9 o’clock. At 10 a.m. alumni will be guests at the home of President and Mrs. E. C. Elliott. Returning to the Union building at noon, the grads will be entertained at a dinner in the ballrooms. At this time golden anniversary, silver anniversary, and loyalty certificates will be presented to several of the graduated classes. Following the dinner, the visitors will attend the baccalaureate exercises in the Hall of Music, after which the week-end activities will close with farewell songs and cheers.
band is the best college band in America; it begins where other bands leave off.” He complimented Albert P. Stewart and Prof, P. S. “Spots” Emrick and said that their music is a great asset to the University. The slogan of the male GalaWeeker was brought to light when, as we left Mr. Ade and twisted through the throng of alumni, we heard one gentleman definitely tell his wife, “You can go see the greenhouse, I’m going over to the football game.” (Famous last words.) Although the “old timers” were scattered throughout the Union, the convening place was a room across from the Alumni Office in the new addition labeled “Elegant ’80’s and Gay ’90’s.” There we met Albert F. Alward, ’97, of Chicago, who said that the new buildings were so numerous that he was afraid the grassi would be covered. He said that in talking to the present-day students he had found them actually much the same as in his under-graduate days. Mr. Alward remarked that he thought the Fieldhouse especially remarkable. PM Instructor Then we talked to A. P. Jamison, ’95, who taught practical mechanics (GE now) at the University until 1913, and to H. B. Flescher, ’95, of West Lebanon, who thought that the University had a large number of up-to-the-minute buildings. / We talked to Paul W. Covert, ’95, of Franklin who taught in the University one and a half years after his graduation under the late Prof. Michael Golden, godfather of the Golden Shops. Mr. Covert has two sons who have graduated from the University, Bob and Bill. Bill graduated in 1934. Mr. Covert said that he has been in rather close contact with the University and its growth, and does not feel as amazed by the changes as some of his classmates. “Old timer” Harry E. Rank, ’84, of West Lafayette, said that the changes had been remarkable in that he had seen cattle slaughtered in the oval, around which now reside some of the most dignified and beautiful buildings of the cam-
Prof. Grover C. Blalock of the electrical engineering school has been issued a building permit to erect a completely modern, brick veneer, four - family apartment building on the south, side of Sylvia Street near Grant. Charles H. Miners, city clerktreasurer, announced Friday that, the permit is for $18,400, and that construction will start within a week.
For the third time in succession Prank Stephens, of Star City, won the grand sweepstakes for eggs yesterday in the anual University Egg and Baby Chick show held in ebnnection with Gala Week. Noel Shaver, of Crawfordsville, shared the spotlight With Stephens by winning top honors in the chick show.

pus. Mr. Rank listed University Hall, Ladies’ Hall (torn down), the old Pharmacy building (now building nOi 2), a dormitory, Heavilon Hall, and a small Armory as the buildings on campus during his Undergraduate days. Students Same E. L. Simpson, ’99, of Fort Wayne, said that what staggered him was the $5,000,000 that the University has spent on advancements during the past year. He complimented Albert P. Stewart and his choir on their performances. In reply to whether he thought the present-day student different from the ’99 model Mr. Simpson said, “They’re the same breed of pups.” Clarence M. Bivens, ’92, of West Lafayette, said he felt that the student spirit contained no more enthusiasm noW-a-days than when he was in school, and that the biggest difference from the University of the old days is the present-day flux of events and activities for students. At the time Mr. Bivins was standing in the oval watching the University Band parade, and, evidently reminiscing, remarked that in '90 and ’91 the military department had held inspection right there. At one time, he continued, a sham battle had been held in the southeast corner. Mr. Bivins was a three year military man, anfi captain of Company B, one of the five companies then organized. Misses Dean Coulter Walter I. Snider, ’92, of Lafayette, said that he missed Dean Emeritus Stanley Coulter, godfather of Stanley Coulter Hall, who is necessarily absent from Gala Week because of his wife’s illness.

He will also discuss some of his own experiences with those attending the meeting.
Both Mr. Bivins and Mr. Snider said that they were soon to get their 50 year certificates, and both hope to reach that goal. Because he seemed to express so well the general attitude of the “old timers” in his enthusiasm for the University, we asked Mr. Snider just how he felt about the present University. In reply he said, “I’m proud of Purdue.” Other Grads Among other graduates on the campus for the Gala Week celebration were H. Robinson Safford, ’96, of Houston, Tex., who is executive vice-president of the Missouri Pacific Railroad; Robert E. Woodruff, ’05, of Cleveland, 0., president of the Erie Railroad; William L. Batt, ’07, president of SKF Industries, Inc.; Claude P. Wickard, ’16, undersecretary of Agriculture, Dept, of Agriculture in Washigton, D, C.; Ralph B. Howland, ’10, of the United Engineers and Construction Co., Inc. in Philadelphia, Pa.; Charles D. McAllister, ’20, who flew from Kelly Field in Texas where he is an officer for Gala Week; and Adam Wallace, who entered the University in 1874 and graduated in ’78 with the first graduating class.
