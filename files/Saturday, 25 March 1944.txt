iThe second floor of the Union has been hous- > ing the shfellSk'^f three student organizations - for some*time.-Shpposedly all three originally were organized to serve the students, but be-
own lethargy, all aie now merely groups with apparently no more purpose on the campus Ihian to perpetuate themselves. Probably the largest and best known of the three is the Student Senate with its self‘-cen-tered, self-inspired record of doing little f^r ' ^“e r^t of the student body and accomplislv hig even less. All this, however, is nbt hy any ' means Ihe fault of the Senate—it is the fault
as a whole. , 31ie purpose of the organization is to “further‘%e best interests of Purdue, University in all matters which come within the province of the StudehtS by serving as an intermediary
