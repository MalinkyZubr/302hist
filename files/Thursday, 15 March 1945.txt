That’s what.it’s for . ‘ r andf that’s what it should do. .We do not pre- ■ tend to be all-knowing or to give news of < •vSrbrid-shaking events, because we believe .other existing sources could far outshine our feeble efforts. “But we do want to reflect student opinion hpiy campus life as truthfully and inas possible, The Exponent is a laboratory, a non-credit iabf)ratory> where students put in long hours "work and receive li^^ or no recognition in order that the s^tudents of the University may have easy access to the news of "ithe.campus. llo'w Would you like to read bulletin boards, to fijid put what was happening on campus ?
