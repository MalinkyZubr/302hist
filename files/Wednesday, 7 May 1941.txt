Debris Comes Out Monday; 96 Still Left By Mary Lou Losey The 1941 Debris, just off the presses, will be available Monday. This is the first time in Debris history that the distribution date has been announced ahead of time. Maybe they have decided to give absent-minded students time to hunt up those stubs they purchased at last fall’s registration. No stub, no Debris, ’member? Also, here is some free advice to this year’s freshmen. A half dozen Debris is a man’s load, and we’re not kiddin’! The advice just given is based on the story we heard last year—^’bout the two pledges who walked over to collect the thirty or forty-odd copies of the yearbook for their house. A rescue party had to be sent out. This year’s Debris is unique in several respects. There are writeups by students and organizations, and a brand new feature called “Boy Meets Girl.” It is also rumored that the Debris has gone modern and published some of its pages in technicoloA The book may still be purchased at the Debris table outside of the Sweet Shop or at the Debris office. There are only 96 copies left, and they are going! going! almost gone!

British Repulse Attack In Iraq; Maintain Bases
By Helen Kirkpatrick SPECIAL CABLE To The Chicago Daily News Foreign Service. Copyright, 1941 Chicago Daily News, Inc. London, May 6.—^British troops continue to hold their own in the port and airdrome at Basra and at the Habbaniyah Airdrome in Iraq, London heard today. From Cairo the Middle East command reported: “In the Habbaniya area our aircraft were again active yesterday. Hostile shelling was intermittent and inaccurate. In the Basra area the situation remains quiet.” Unless the Germans rush units from Syria to Premier Rashid Ali al Gailani’s assistance—^which it is thought they are likely to do—the British expect to be able to contain the Iraqi revolt. British Spare Bagdad Despite the fact that the British have Iraq completely at their mercy through mastery of the air in that part of the world, they have not yet used it to terrorize Rashid Ali’s rebel government into submission. There is nothing to prevent the British from pealing with Bagdad as the Germans dealt with Rotterdam and Belgrade. They have refrained from doing so, first, because they still feel that the Iraqi “rebellion” may be subdued, and, second, because the British do not like such tactics. Perhaps, too, they have not been convinced that German methods really pay. German and Iraqi reports flow in, reporting the “fall” of Habbaniyah and the “encirclement” of the Port of Basra. These, it is categorically stated, are not true. The British forces at Habbaniyah are still in full control of the British-built airdrome city, and the British still hold the port and airdrome of Basra, according to latest reports. Berlin states that 20,000 Indian troops have landed at Basra. Mothers' Luncheon Tickets On Sale Today Advanced sale of tickets for the annual Mother’s Day luncheon Saturday from 12 noon to 1 o’clock in the South Union ballioom opens this morning.

The amendment was made with the approval of the dean of men and faculty advisors of the Senate. r.l.h.

As The Editor Sees It...
Well, Gala Week is over but the memory lingers on. A memory of “The College Widow,” the Class of ’91, Joe Reichman’s band, the Founder’s Day banquet, Mary Ellen Chase, and a long list of intangibles from overheard conversations and the crowd in general. Along about this time the seniors begin to realize that they are a part in the long line of Boilermakers. They realize that they are upholding a tradition that has not been broken since 1869., Because since that time Purdue has been turning out graduates who in turn have been selling themselves and Purdue to the world. The seniors realize, perhaps for the first time, their obligation in this reciprocal work. The Gala Week Committee, Eth Baugh, and the other co-op-erating organizations are to be congratulated for their fine job in putting on such a complete program. Each year Gala Week activities have grown and this one was no exception. We can expect in the next few years to have the whole town turned topsy-turvy for this occasion. Dr. Huh Shih’s Baccalaureate address could not have been more timely. Without a doubt he has keynoted the duty of the college graduate in the uncertain times that lie ahead. All too many of us have refused to think about the problems around us. With the exception of the absurd waste of time in reading the simple Commencement directions the Baccalaureate exercises went off without a hitch. Inasmuch as the instructions will be repeated it seemed very useless to describe in almost minute detail the Commencement exercises. Especially while visiting parents and friends waited. Just a matter of opinion, of course, but we’re personally wondering just how many will remember for thirty days just which side of the stage they mount, or when to rise, etc. We don’t believe in omens ourselves but that Army plane that kept fiying over the mall while the graduates were parading made us awfully uneasy. And now for those term reports.

The ^th Colunm
We noticed last Sunday. During the Baccalaureate service. That is, between wondering which two or three of our dozen problems to take with us into the cold cruel world. That this will be the 67th class to graduate from the University. Which in itself is not so astounding. ^ / Some people do graduate you know.
But this is also the 72nd year of the University’s existance. And according to our figures there is a five year lapse between those two. Which is interesting. It seems to have taken the first man five years. Too.
Of course we may bp wrong. Perish the thought. But anyway,. , . It’s consoling.
See where Senator Pepper says it is time for the United States to “get tough.” We did once before you know. And practically whipped the Kaiser single handed. With the aid of ,a handful! of French and British. Reminds us of the philosophy of the late Will Rogers. According to him, he’d “try most things once, some twice.” Which is practically where we stand today. If you change that some to anything.

And as long as we are quoting from the great men of history we might put in a plug for the great emancipator. Honest Abe. His theory, somewhat modified. Is that some people are fools all of the time. All of the people are fools some of the time. And some are just damn fools.
See by the papers where Capt. Roosevelt is now en route to Cairo where he will make little side trips. Observing the African campaign. All we have to say is that if the trait is at all inheritable.

Irishman’s lllttsinns
By Joseph Patrick Dolan A couple of -weeks ago -we -wrote a rather top-soil article on the “scandal” Notre Dame -was facing concerning the sujpposed infiltration of certain Boston College athletes to the Notre Dame campus, hut rather close scrutiny on the matter in our spare time reading seems to cast everything but detrimental statements at N. D.’s Mr, Leahy. _I.I_ To start th^ local bugs crying out loud, the second -week of Notre Dame football practice -was the scene of a squad cut. “Kockne never cut his squad,” said South Bend fans, “neither did Anderson or Layden. If a kid wants to play football at school, why cut him and put him on the sidelines?” echoed all South Bend. Mr. Leahy seems to have been a gentleman throughout all this bickering which has and will do neither Boston College nor Notre Dame any good. So we think it no more than right that one of the more favorable stories about Leahy be related. _I-I_ Now the entire scandal, if it can be called that, started when it was i found (I wonder) that a certain Boston College freshman, Gilbert Bouley, by far the best freshman tackle prospect of the East last fall, was planning to follow Leahy to Notre Dame; and he was, too. Bouley is a high ranking schqjar as well as an expert tackle, and after being refused a job at Notre Dame to pay for his tuition by Leahy, he quit school at Boston College in^an effort to make Leahy see his determination. Butf Leahy is firm in his warning to Bouley that if he comes to N. D. he won’t play football. —I-I— Leahy wants Bouley as much as Bouley wants to play for Notre Dame, but Leahy is protecting his employer from scandal. Bouley recently returned to classes at B. C., but dropped out again after three weeks at Boston. Bouley’s father ■wrote Leahy a pleading letter to allow his boy to make the shift to N. D.; to which Leahy answered that the lad could come to Notre Dame (that, he couldn’t prohibit), but NO football. —I-I— There is an example of taking a bitter pill and at the same time cutting your own throat. Then there is the recent New Orleans news-
ND Battle Rained Out; Cats Here On Friday South Bend, Indiana, May 6.—(Special to the Purdue Exponent)—heavy burst of rain here just before noon caused the postponement of the Boilermaker-Notre Dame return diamond battle today. Both teams were very anxious to play off the previously registered 3-3 ten inning tie game played at West Lafayette April 10, but the grounds were ruled too wet about two hours before game time. Previous to the cancellation of today’s tilt the Boilermakers had played 18 contests unaffected 'by inclement weather conditions, most of them being played under ideal conditions. According to Coach Fehring, the game will not be played later^ but the B oilermakerIrish baseball fued will remain deadlocked until next year. Waiting For Wildcats Tomorrow the Riveters will begin priming for the week-end battles with one of last year’s codefending Big Ten nines. Northwestern. The Purple is at present tied for second place in the conference. Last week they had no conference games, but handed Notre Dame a pair of shellackings in a two game series. One of the team’s leading hitters is Bill DeCorrevant, who last year was one of the main reasons for the Wildcat’s successful
paper flare-up. It seems that Mr. Leahy “stole” a few of Louisiana’s best prep school athletes. -I-I— Now here’s the straight stuff on that accusation, 0. J. Key and Paul Limont, seniors at Jesuit high school. New Orleans, have decided to go to Notre Dame; therefore, “they have been” lured away from Tqlane, Looking at history proves that the New Orleans papers are also swan-singing. _I.I_ Limont’s papa went to Boston College, therefore he likes Leahy; -SO leaning toward (he Leahy type football, he’ll send his lad to the place where that type of football is played—^not B. C. Now this Key lad is from Bay St. Louis, Miss., the home of the great Notre Dame halfback, Marchmont Schwaftz, of ’29, ’30, and ’31. Marchy is still “Mr. God” in that area, and his success at N. D. would naturally draw any lad as good as Key, __I.I_ How well I remember Schwartz. I sSw him play when I was 11 years old. He beat Army that rainy day on Soldiers Field, Chicago, with one 6 pointer.

Golf Chipping Contest On IM Green Friday Something new in golf competition, namely, an all campus chipping contest will start at the practice green at the northwest corner of Intramural Field at 4 o’clock Friday.
By Ted Clark Alex Kampouris, utility infielder for the Brooklyn Dodgers, is reputed to be the only player of Greek extraction now active in the major leagues. The story of Alex’s career seems to be “good field, no hit,” for he has consistently been among the topflight men in fielding averages, but seldom hits over the .250 mark. After the minor league seasoning process at Sacramento, “Kampy” worked as an effective Keystone combination with Billy Meyers for the Cincinnati Reds. Prior to his coming to Brooklyn Alex was with Bill Terry’s New York Giants. > : —s-s— The Indiana track team possesses the nearest thing to record breaker that has been seen in outdoor track circles, so far this year. Big Archie Harris has dropped his customary shot put emphasis to take up a vigorous campaign of concentration on the discus. In a recent dual meet, the dusky Harris floated the discus 171 feet from the throwing circle. This mark falls only three feet short of the accepted world’s record, set in the 1938 Olympic games in Berlin. With several months of track activities left to his disposal, Harris may have the old record cracked and the track world left ■with a new mark to shoot at. —S-S— Morton Cooper and Walker Cooper, two among many youngsters on Billy Southworth’s St. Louis Cardinals, form the only brother battery in baseball today. These youngsters are two of the reasons why the Cards are being picked by the ^ages to finish well up in the National League race. Rick Ferrell and Wes Ferrell were formerly the only brother combination in either league before Wes was traded. -^S-S— “The flower that blooms in the spring,” is the title hung on Johnny Cooney of the Boston Bees by recent scribblings from nation-wide sports desks. If the Major Leagues ever had a perennial, Cooney is the man. Back in-1921, Johnny was one of the best pitchers in big league ball and after a short detour to the bushes, Cooney once again blossomed forth in Major League diamonds; this time aS an outfielder. When the aging Cooney again lost his usefullness, the Bees took pity on him and hired the veteran as an outfield coach. In the middle of the 1940 season, an epidemic of injuries in the Boston outfield drew the 40 year old Cooney back to active duty. To everybody’s surprise, Johnny played over 100 games of magnificentr'ball; fielding flawlessly and pacing Boston hitting with an average well over the .300 mark.

'— -rOlsen, L0wis Lead Invasion Of mini Thinclads Here Saturday By Joe Dawson On the one-fourth mile oval in Ross-Ade Stadium, the Riveter track squad will be host to the powerful Illinois team Saturday afternoon at 1:00 o’clock in their first dual conference meet odt the outdoor season.
mini Powerful Due to their very impressive showing so far this season, the visitors can boast of one of the most outstanding teams in the middle west. Two weeks ago the boys from Champaign literally crushed Washington University of St. Louis by an unbelievable score of 123 to 8. Last week in a Big Ten meet they trounced Northwestern 87 to 38. Largely responsible for this amazing record are several of the greatest athletes in the country. Heading this group is a fellow the name of Olsen, who at the present time holds the World’s Indoor record in the low hurdles. Also, the mini squad boasts of the champion broad jumper in the coiiference in the person of Bill Le^wis. This negro ace has the makings of another Jesse Owens since he is an outstanding dash man as well as being one of the best broad jumpers in the country. Brown vs. Holderman Captain Park Brown "will undoubtedly collect several points in his favorite events, the one-half mile and the mile. In the Big Ten meet this year he placed second behind Campbell Kane in the one-half mile. Riveter Holderman was close behind in third'place, so the running of this event Saturday will mark the renewal of an old fued. According to Coach Phillips, Holderman will be entered in both the half mile and mile, since the Mg boy is very anxious to redeem himself and beat Brown.^ In addition to Holderman, Phillips is counting on Rankin in the hurdles, Weber in the shot put and Anthony in the quarter mile to be the chief Riveter point getters. Greek Track Meet Annual Inter-fraternity Track and Field Meet will be held Wednesday and Thursday, May 14 and 15 in Ross-Ade Stadium. Entry blanks should be returned to the Intramural office not later than noon of Monday, May 12. Changes and additions will be allowed during the meet, but Chief Clevett ad'vises all entrants to read the rules on page 14 of the Intramural Handbook. Not more than two men from each fraternity may compete in a single event, with the exception of the relay. Participation points go
