Exponent Publishes Highlights And Lowlights Of Summer School Activities
By Glen Pickerel
In a few more days finals will be over, and students will again begin to register for the twenty-eighth annual Summer Session here on the campus. Many of us ■will be packing our trunks to go home, but even though most of us will be leaving good old Purdue, there will still be a summer publication of the Exponent to keep the home-
fires cheery.
Summer Session Highlights Here are a few high-lights of last summer’s Exponent issues: Last year’s Summer Session got under way on June 16, ■with the registration of approximately 1,600 Students in the Executive building, under the direction of Dr. F. B. Knight of the University di^vision
of education.
Harry J, Reed, director of the Ag Experiment station, and the department of Ag Extension, was named head of the Ag school. Reed succeeded Skinner, who was on leave several months because of illness, and who retired at the end of June. University Glee Club, directed by A. P. Stewart, took first place at the University Music Festival on June 17, and then participated in the Chicagoland Music Festival on Saturday, August 19, in Chicago,
111.
Housemothers Over 90 sorority house mothers began their four week’s study course on house management, food supervision, and direction of labor June 19. Housemothers from many sections of the United States were ^present. The summer session picnic was held June 24, at .the Ross Civic Camp. An archery exhibition was given by Going-Back Chiltosky, a Cherokee from the Indian school at Cherokee, N. C., before the picnic
supper which was served at 6 o’clock. < I The traditional summer session recreational feature, “Games on the Green” were started on the varsity training field Thursday, June 29, with the students and the faculty mixing shots in the various games
of skill.
Education Clinic Educators from every section of the country converged on the campus July 10 for the second annual Educational Leaders’ Clinic, which continued through July 13. Dean L. A. Pechstein, of the University of Cincinnati, and Thomas E. Benner, dean of the college of education at the University of Illinois, were speakers during the clinic. To the lilting music of Jack Teagarden and his band, the second annual summer session Prom was held Friday, July 28, ■with Ellen Kepner and Don Spring leading the grand march around the Union ballroom. Four hundred couples danced to the “I Got a Right to Sing the Blues” band from 9 to 1. The final group of Summer Session plays was presented August 3, in the Ross-Ade Stadium. A trio of plays, “Wonder Hat,” “The Tiger’s Claw,” and “He Ain’t Done Right by Nell” constituted the evening’s
performance.
The End
The summer’s activities were brought to a close with final examinations, which were held August 10 to 12, as students assembled in their classrooms to put forth the knowledge which they tried so hard to pick up while “joeing” about the campus. And with them went the last editions of the Exponent, which had faithfully tried to bring to its readers the latest events of inter-
est.

"Fashions Out Of Test Tubes" Will Feature Glass Bathing Suit
By Lee Ruffner
We saw a lot of things come out of test tubes in the year we struggled ■with Doe Martin’s freshman chemistry, but there was never a dress or a glass bathing suit or a hat or jewelry among them. Maybe it’s because of that that we’re going to be very interested in seeing “Fashions Out of Test Tubes,” because, according to the very best information all those things will be in that particular show when it is presented at the University on the
night of June 14.
This fashion show is scheduled to be held in the new Hall of Music for the benefit of the general public and all summer school students, and will show a number of the innovations in the world of fashion whi.ch have been brought about by scientists and research workers in industrial laboratories. Some of the developments in fabrics and other wearing apparel to be modeled are a glass bathing suit (we’ll believe that when we see it), a hostess gown produced from the basic materials
Movies
The show ■will include not only the modelling on the stage, but a film “Fashion Favorites’ ’and musical numbers under the direction of A1 Stewart, and is to be one of the highlights of the two-day session on “Recent Trends in Chemistry” which is to be sponsored by the University chapter of the American Chemical Society, June 14-16. Many of the new fabrics which will be shown Friday night are sti^l in the experimental stage, but are being woven, dyed and designed especially for this display. Amongthe number of laboratory created materials are some which ■will be shown to the public for the first time. These newcomers i*ange from plastic luggage to Cinderella glass
slippers.
And that glass bathing suit!

GRIN AND BEAR IT
By Lictiiy
PURDUE UNIVERSITY, May SO^Reliable sources reported today that the Undergraduate Army, throwing wave after wave of students armed with slide rules against a stuhhorn faculty front line in the hope of recovering possession of the new Hall of Music, was progi’essing slowly. B-U-L-L, faculty news service, stated that the professorial forces were holding their own, and that the students were making no progress as usual. However, it is reported that the left undergraduate salient, proceeding north from the Union Building, has gained complete domination of ^ the Civil Engineering Building and is battling its way into the main halls of Heavilon Hall. Take Library y— Forces of the right undergraduate “joe” salient left the west door of the Union, met little resistance in the Library (where anti-faculty sentiments were high ) and is now marching north on the Biology building, an important stronghold in the faculty defense of the Hall of Music. Faculty troops, their strongest (iivisions still reenforcing the Executive Building, Physics Building, Women’s Gymnasium, Armory, Pharmacy Building, and the Biology Building, are well supplied with dailies, tests, and exams to bombard the students. Intensive fighting was evidenced by the turmoil in room 129 of the Electrical Engineering Building' where several faculty detachments turned loose the 3-hour exams on students attacking from that direction. Chemical Warfare Under the command of Doctor Martin, the faculty’s chemical warfare division was having marked success w'ith their swift and endless barrage of dailies. An official communique from the student GHQ in the Union claims a faculty army to be completely surrounded in the Fieldhouse by five Cary Hall Brigades. Cary Hall Brigades have also taken over the tunnel system on the northern front and are slowly progressing toward the center of the campus, but with terrific losses. Elliott Denies Advances Generalissimo Elliott’s tent today disaffirmed the report that a student battery, mechanized with automatic calculating machines, had forced its way through the tunnel system from the Union and had entered the lower floor of the Executive Building. The Ag student army has invaded the south campus and is now crossing State Street, advancing on University Hall as its next objective. For the time being, the Honie Economics Building has been declared neutral and is being used as a ward for victims of both sides.

CuriousV/omenDream THeir Way Through Men's Bum Room By Ruth Weiss ' “
We might entitle this feature, “The Great Mystery Surrounding the Bum Room,” but the eds would stop reading right here, so before you sleepy-eyed studious gentlemen lay aside this famous paper, we had better explain our nonsense. The co-eds on campus envy you! We wonder what lies behind the thick door leading to the little (or is it big ?) room on the second floor of the Union. Bum Room, humph. Is it a room for all Purdue bums? (Gosh, who’d a thunk there were such creatures on this fine campus.) Or is it a joe name for a lounge?
Or what the—is it?
“Imagination”
Hold tight, we feel our imagination running away with us. Here we go into what is our conception of the Bum Room. First we tug open the door. Having accomplished this, we trip lightly into a dark hallway. Sneakingly, we climb a flight or two of steep steps. (It must be high to create an air of
mystery.)
Then ... ahhh the Bum Room. The first thing we notice is a room full of men draped over luxurious chairs and couches. Windows are very important here. That is, if you can see a window with all the men hanging their heads out, and we don’t mean for a breath of fresh air. (Heaven knows they need some
fresh air after some of the bulloney which is slung there.) This room has an atmosphere of informality. We wouldn’t be a bit surprised if clothes were a minor de-
tail. Anything for comfort.
Second Hand Stories
A radio is blasting forth the hottest swing. Bonnie Baker also has her fling; that is, on the radio. Also in the way of music, the bums, (’scuse please), the men, sin^ to their hearts content. Hope they have sound-proof walls. Or maybe a few girls would like to hear some of the songs, if they hadn’t taught it to
them originally.
The main topics of conversation, we suppose, are women, sex, and politics. Studies have no chance here. If you want a well-rounded education, the Bum Room is the place to get it. It certainly will be
well-rounded.
Did We Guess Well? Those of you who must be here this summer will enjoy the cool breezes in this room. At least you will be able to find a quiet place without the incessant chattering of
women.
Now that we’ve given our views about the Bum fedbm (and believe me when we say we have never been there, much as we wish we had been) how far wrong were we?

By Joseph Patrick Dolan And here goes the last sports column of ye old Exponent for the scholastic year of 1939-40. We’ve had our share of thrills this year as our famous football team struggled through a tough season with the entire squad suffering from some injury or other. —I-I— We’ve seen Piggy Lambert’s basketball squad bring home the bacon as usual, and Herman Phillips shoot the works with the best track squad the Purdue fans have seen in ten years. -1-1— The baseball team, although failing to click in conference ball, won the mythical state championship. But in watching a year of Boilermaker sports there stands out three mdividual performances of Purdue athletes. -1-1— First there was the remarkable Purdue rally at Illinois in the final minutes of a hectic basketball season that was climaxed by Frosty Sprowl’s calm shooting in the final minutes that sent a confident Illini club to defeat the hard way. And then there was the performance of Danny Fisher during this season of sports. —I-I— '' Danny Fisher is a competitor. And in these words Dan is described thoroughly. He overcame a sight deficiency to become the greatest driver on a hardwood court that Purdue has seen since the days of John Wooden. And Dan’s great run in the mile relay during the state meet last Saturday that made up twenty yards of a twenty-five yard Purdue deficit against Notre Dame made something catch in our throats as we realized that this great effort was the last that “Perpetual Motion” Fisher would make for Purdue on the athletic run-ways. —I-I— Also there is the performance of the Purdue student body at athletic contests. I firmly believe that it is the student body as well as the coaches and team itself that wins ball games for Purdue. If Mr. and Miss Purdue could be as close to Purdue’s athletes as I’ve managed to be for three years, they would yell and encourage their lungs out at ball games. And does the band get to go to N. Y. ? —I-I— Encouragement from the stands

explodes any athlete, and these Purdue athletes not only explode, but they actually burn with the assis-
tance of crowds support.
—I-I—
And so with paying respect to three factors in Boilermaker success of the past year, we say so long until next year, a year with three home football games that will bring the caviar and champagne crowd to bully for old Purdue, nine rahs, and a whistle (thanks to cousin Louie Sears).
—I-I—
We’ve got a basketball crown to defend next year, also; so come on back to ole Purdue, lads and lasses, and raise hell for another year.

Betas Garner 770 Points. AGR Noses Out PKS By 2 Points For Close Second Beta Theta Pi fraternity clinched the annual interfratemity participation trophy by collecting a total of 770 points, the intramural department announced yesterday. Close behind were the Alpha Gamma Rho boys who garnered 753 points and nosed out Phi Kappa Sigma by only two counters for the runner-up
position.
Every Event Each of the first six fraternities to place in this year’s contest entered every event of the entire season. Kappa Sigma, Lambda Chi Alpha, and Sigma Alpha Mu finished in close order for fourth, fifth, and sixth places respectively. Speedy Beta teams outran the field to collect the winning totals in both the indoor and the outdoor track meets and tied with Delta Tau Delta for first in the indoor relay carnival. They also won in volleyball. The Betas assured themselves of victory by placing three men in Sigma Delta Psi, national athletic honorary.
Seconds
Alpha Gamma Rho proved the value of collecting second place points by coming in second in the contest with only one victory during the entire season. The Ags defeated the Lambda Chis in B-bas-ketball, but took seconds in track meet, softball, A-basketball and horseshoes. Phi Kappa Sigma took undisputed firsts in touchball, golf, and wrestling, and a second in volleyball, but were surpassed by the AGR’s second places. Pi Kappa Alpha was the only fraternity to collect four undisputed firsts, but was left far behind because of failure to participate in three events.
Trophy
In reward for their efforts. Beta Theta Pi will receive a beautiful gold and walnut trophy topped by a large victory figure and adorned with the symbols of various intramural sports. The trophy stands over two feet high.
Four Boilermakers Nominated To Face Pacific Coast Stars Four Boilermakers were picked last Saturday to be among those representing the Big Ten in its annual meet with a picked crew of Pacific Coast Conference stars at Evanston, on June 17.

The one thing we noticed about this -vfrai is that the first liar hasn’t got a chance In the air raid on Paris, the first French story leported 150 German planes in the attack. Seven were shot dovm. Fiench losses were a Inmimum. ^ ♦ * >!■ The Germans said no, there were 300 planes in the attack. They said that 36 French pursuit ships were shot down and 300 demolished on the ground. ♦ So the French said O. K. So there were 300 in the raid, we shot down 70 of them. Doable and redoable. * * * The one that worries us thooigh is the newspaper story that reported three allied divisions fighting their way into Dunkerque, and the one next to it that reported divisions fighting their way out. Thi^s a mortality rate of a negative 25 percent. « * * We went to the show the other night and heard Senator Pepper in the news reel. We agree with him, we’ve got to fight, and the minute Hitler crosses the Wabash we’re going to grab a gun and get right into this mess ourselves. No one can cut in on our ternary} « 4c III This business about landing parachute troops in New Jersey is all well and good, but the way we look at it IS that it’s New Jersey’s worry.

To the Editor— The editorial in Sunday morning’s edition was excellent. As Charles Lindbergh said in his recent radio address: “We are in no danger of war if we keep out of other people’s business.” The only purpose of $4,000,000,060 spent for armaments this year, is to prepare us to fight with the allies. Do we went to do this ? Do we want to send over another A. E. F. ? If not, then we had better speak up. Let youth speak up and say: “We do not want to go.” Let parents speak up and say: “We do not want to send our boys to fight on foreign soil.” Let the American people arouse itself and say to its foolish leaders, “This is not our war and we want none of it.” —W. M. (William McFadden) Andrews And Lincoln Receive Appointments Dr. Frederick Andrews and Dr. Ralph E. Lincoln have recently been appointed to the staff of the Agriculture Experiment Station. They will become associates on the research staff. Dr. Andrews will be a member of the animal husbandry staff and will do special research in the field of leproductive physiology. Dr. Lincoln will be a member of the botany department and will work on problems of breeding vegetable crops for resistance to diseases.
To The Seniors . . . who will culminate four years of work here at the University next Sunday, we extend our congratulations . . . «and condolences. We’ve watched you work and strain for the day which is upon you. We’ve overheard your gripes and desires to “get out of this hole.” But last week we noticed that your tune changed. ^ Suddenly it has dawned on you that you're going to leave Purdue. Suddenly you have realized that you’re going to sever the ties you have made here in the last four years. If you are the least bit sentimental you might reflect that you aren’t going to hear the clock in Heavilon tower chime out the quarter hour. You’re going to substitute other sounds and noises for Purdue’s ancient sym|)ol. No longer will you feel that thrill the first time the band comes down Grant street for the first pep session of the year. No longer will you get that warm feelinfe inside when Prexy Elliott makes one of those convo introductions. Po those of you who have looked upon your four years here as a grind we extend our sincere condolences. You have missed a great many of the things that Purdue has to offer. Perhaps in retrospect you will come to appreciate the University and will return occasionally to keep alive your associations here To those of you for whom the end of the trail brings a lump In the throat much too large to swallow we offer congratulations. You have breathed more than the sharp, stinging odor of the chem labs, the hot, greasy odors of the steam table, the strong, earthy odor of the stable. You have breathed the spirit of Purdue. In the days that follow, we are sure that you will be able to'look back on your stay here as the shortest and happiest period of your life. We are not being sentimental, but we’ve talked to quite a few of you these past few days and we know how you feel. To all of you, then, regardless of your feelings, we say “Auf Wiedersehen” and Good Luck!”
