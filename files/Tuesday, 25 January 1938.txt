Book On Canning^ Tells
Of Hybrid Experiments
Describing in detail the breeding program followed by Glenn M. Smith of the agricultural experiment station and his associates in selecting sweet corn strains of outstanding quality and sturdiness, “The Canning Clan,” written by Earl Chapin May, and published by the MacMillan Company of New York, is a history of the canning industry during the last 12 decades.
The work contains a brief history of the rapid rise of Golden Bantam sweet corn to the peak of popularity, as well as a treatise on the sweet com breeding program followed at the University since 1921 apd a description of the experiments leading to Golden Cross Bantam corn, a Purdue hybrid, "vvhich is now by far the most popular sweet corn being grown in the United States.
Indiana Weather

University officials announced last night the presentation of 700 acres of land to the University by Isaiah M. Miller of Upland. Miller’s gift includes the original homestead tract of 610 acres, which was obtained by his father from the government jn 1838, and an adjoiniilig tract of 90 acres. Located one mile east of Upland, in Grant county, the farm is expected to be especially of value to the farmers of east central Indiana who own the same type of soil. The farm will be devoted to experimental purposes “for the improvement of agricultural and rural home life in Indiana,’? as stated by the donor.
The farm will be a memorial to Miller’s father'and mother, and will be known as “The Miller Purdue Memorial Farm.” Miller h^s for many years been a leading cattle and sheep raiser, and the donated land has been kept in blue grass pasture for an extended period.

Board Approves $25 Fee Increase
Announcement was made yesterday by President E. C. Elliott that the Board of Trustees approved the increase of tuition fees for out-of-state en-
gineering students from $50.00 to $75.00 a semester, effective for all engineering students enrolling in the University for the first time in September, 1938, or thereafter, and effective for all engineering students in September 1941. This increase will not affect students now in the University provided they graduate by 1941.
Value Road Show
Equipment At Quarter Million
Highway building and maintenance equipment and material, which is valued at $200,000 to $250,000 may be seen by any interested students, faculty or townspeople today, tomorrow and Thursday morning by a visit to the annual road show in the University Armory. The show, a feature of the road schoo!^ being held this week, is primarily for the officials and others here attending the school but the general public is cordially invited to attend and see what is needed in present day road building and maintenance. Walter Q. O’Neal, of Ci’awfordsville, secretary and treasurer of the Highway Material and Equipment Association, the sponsoring organization, is in charge of the show again this year. * Display Includes Many Features The display includes such features as truck mounted steam shovels that will lift half a yard of dirt at one bite and costing around $7,000; huge tank compressors that put on tar and oil and cost about the same figures. Monster graders that cost between four and five thousand dollars apiece; mighty tractors and trucks that are necessary in road woi’k all are on display.
Along with them are exhibits of safety guard rails, metal pipe for tunnels on railroads as well as the bridges and culverts; asphalt, cement, creosote treating methods, oil companies, and numerous other things that enter into the huge road business of the day.
Admission to the show is free, and it will be time well spent especially for engineering students to see the show, a number of the instructors have said.

Outsiders Will Have
Trouble Trying To Crash Home Games
Outsiders are going to have a tough time trying to get into home basketball games on student tickets and passports, according to a report from the University Athletic Department. Acting Director Robert C. Woodworth said last night the number of ticket takers will be doubled for the remainder of the hardwood season, starting with the next game, against Indiana’s Fightin' Hoosiers on February 5.
Student reserved tickets carry the statement: “Not good for admission unless presented with identification card.” The identfication cards, or “passports,” are nontransferable.
Students Lose Rights If a passport is shown by any
other person than to whom it was issued originally, both the reserved ticket and the passport will be taken up. The student identified by the passport will lose his right to attend convocations and athletic contests for the remainder of the year.
Best seats for basketball games are reserved for students. Director Woodworth said, and the Athletic Department is going to see that outsider's do not deprive students of the privilege of occupying these seats.
Dr. Young Addresses Producers' Meeting Dr. E. C. Young, of the University farm management department, addressed the annual meeting of the Indianapolis Producers’ Association, yesterday noon in the Antlers Hote^ in the capitol city. He discussed the general economic situation and the outlook for commodity prices during the coming year.
While in Indianapolis last night, Dr. Young conferred with Dr. E, C. Johnson, of Washington, D.) C., and C. J. Bradley and Arthur Mauch formerly on the Purdue staff, but now of Louisville, concerning research in farm credits.
Publication Dates The next issue of the Exponent will be published Thursday, January 27. The regular schedule will be resumed February 1, when the first issue of the new semester will be distributed.
terday afternoon with a general session presided over by Harry Overesch, Lafayette, vice-president of the City Engineers’ Association. The visitors were welcomed to the University and the road school by Prof. R. B. Wiley," head of the civil engii^ieering school, with a response by C. Dana Ward, of Indianapolis, president of the Highway Materials and Equipment Association.
Lockridge Speaks Yesterday’s session featured a lecture by Earle Lockridge, Assistant Chief Engineer of the Indiana State Highway Commission, who spoke on “The Farm-to-Market Federal Road Program” and a discussion of the effects of road improvement on community and family life by T. A. Dicus, Indiana state highway commissioner. Today’s program has been divided into two sessions, the general session in the morning and four separate sessions in the afternoon.
One of the main features of the week’s sessions will be the Road Show, sponsored by the Highway Materials and Equipment Association and composed of all types and varieties of road building machinery and equipment. The display of trucks, road-graders, etc., worth nearly one-quarter million dollars, is to open this noon in the Armory and will continue until Thursday noon. Officials believe this display should prove especially interesting to engineering students.
Delegates to Relax
This evening at 9 o’clock, an extensive recreational program has been planned to take place in the new Fieldhouse and Gymnasium. Professional wrestling, badminton, and many other events will occupy the spotlight in the evening’s entertainment. Tickets will be passed out to road officials in the Armory at 8:30 p. m.
The Road School, a 24-year-old institution, is held annually at the University for the purpose of bringing together city, county, and state officials, contractors, and equipment men to discuss street and highway problems, construction methods,new road machinery, and highway design.
Dr. Thornton Resigns Post In Favor Of Head
Position At Norfolk
Dr. Samuel F. Thornton, soil chemist of the department of agrronomy and member of the University Agricultural Experiment Station staffs for 10 years, has resigned to head the agricultural service of a Norfolk, Va., fertilizer corporation. His resignation will be effective on January 31.
Dr. Thornton, a Clemson, S. C., College graduate in 1916, obtained his master of science degree from Pm'due in 1930 and doctorate here in 1935, serving that period as a staff member here. He has attained national recognition because of his rapid chemical tests of soils and growing plants to determine the plant food needed by the soil. The testing* plan, as developed by Dr. Thornton, is widely used by county agents and others throughout the United States, and employ the test kit that he developed, to make the rapid plant food tests.
Dr. G. D. Scarseth, associate professor of soils and soils chemist on the staff of the Alabama Experiment Station at Auburn, will take Di*. Thornton’s position. A native of Wisconsin and graduate of the University of Wisconsin, Dr. Scarseth obtained his doctor’s degree from Ohio State University.1 if

THE PimDUE EXPONENT
I Tuesday. January 125. 1936
Following Exponent’s Lead... ... in carrying on a campaign to promote better sportsmanship throughout Big Ten circles other university papers in the conference are taking up the issue. Below we are reprinting an editorial from Minnesota’s student newspaper and a letter written to Northwestern’s daily publication: ‘Minnesota Attitude’ Threat To Basketball (The Minnesota Daily) Visiting basketball teams and officials refer to the growing lack of common courtesy in the Field House as “the Minnesota attitude.” It is characterized chiefly, by the rolling thunder of boos and reverberating howls which are heard after each real or fancied error by the officials. The murmurs of approbation and faint cheers, which are sometimes heard, form secondary features of the attitude, as well as making the hard-working Minnesota cheerleader the most futile figure in the world. The attitude is supported largely by those who sit in some dusty corner behind a steel girder 100 yards away from the players, but who detect every flaw in officiating and support their disgust by 160-seconds of leather-lunged booing. The attitude has for its basis a misconception of the privileges which accompany a ticket of admission. Many believe that a spectator is ipso facto, a referee. There has been, of course, considerable argument over who is most competent to officiate at a basketball game. Many fans argue that they are the best equipped to do the job, although the majority admit never having read a rule book. Those who are familiar with the game insist on a trained referee. It is probably a matter of opinion. The masses likewise argue that they are better judges of a player than the coach, although a few things could be said in his favor. Both factions agi’ee howevei, that it is not cricket to hurl insults or invective at the players. Some go so far as to maintain that those who suggest that the refei’ee is without meiit and scream for his blood are definitely in bad taste. Such persons are probably sentimental extremists". Those most interested in the welfare of the sport—Major John L. Griffiths, Prank McCormick, a few others—are disturbed over the unsportsmanlike conduct in the F'leld House. With full respect for the unpopularity of platitudes, it is still true that a lack of sportsmanship depopularizes a sport.

Open Letter . .. The Daily Northwestern (Editor’s Note; In line with the Daily Northwestern’s policy of fair play and good sportsmanship by all contributing parties in any athletic contest under the university’s auspices, we are printing the following letter. Althoug'h this was sent in anonymously it is supported whole-heartedly by the sport staff). To Whom It May Concern; Tomorrow night Northwestern plays Michigan in
a home basketball game. At the last home game against Ohio State, the booing was terrific, and I know the Ohio players carried away a feeling that the Northwestern student body is a group of extremely poor sports. I suggest that the “intellectuals” who think they know so much about the game get themselves a rule book and see just what constitutes a personal foul. And remember—those boos are carried over the entire Middle West by the radio broadcast of the game. A nice bit of advertising, I’d say! Think befoie you boo, and in any case don’t boo the opposing players while they are shooting a free free throw or basket. Why pick on them ? They appreciate this little courtesy to the opponents. It’s up to the student body to decide whether or not Michigan teams will walk off the floor with the same feeling of resentment against the Northwestern crowd that the Ohio State boys did. Let’s try to be good sports! Signed: N. B. (No Booing)

By Mary Cooley Advanced learning acquired at Groton, Harvard, and Columbia University Law School was insufficient for President Roosevelt to learn how to speak correctly. This conclusion would follow if charges brought by a Columbia professor—a woman at that—are true. She maintains that the President murdered the King’s English on a recent speaking tour. There is consolation for many of us in the fact that the President, too, is fallible in his use of English. And also the charges, now widely publicized, will strengthen the President with the millions and millions of voters who split an occasional infinitive without feeling horror stricken. * * * * An interesting December arrival in New York was Theos Bernard, 28-year-old American Buddhism scholar and Tibetan explorer, who spent five months in Tibet. The Arizona University graduate took still and motion pictures everywhere and recorded ceremonies that even natives of the country had never seen. He photographed the Black Hat Dance, the unveiling of Kiku Banner and the ceremonial of air burial. He taught photography to the natives who accompanied him and thus obtained a camera record of his own participation in the Buddhist religious rites. * * A * Colby College women students have pledged $1,576 to a fund for construction of a Women’s Union Building atop Mayflower Hill, new Colby College campus site. * * * j(i Public petting is getting to be a nuisance on the campus of Louisiana State University, according to the Reveille, student papier.

By Sally McKee If a man walks with a woman carrying an umbrella, should he offer to can-y it for her ? Yes. Is it correct for a woman to let a man perform small courtesies which he offers? Yes. If, on the other hand, he does not offer these courtesies, the woman should not force herself on him. It’s rude. On the campus, one occasionally sees a co-ed waiting for a small service from a passing boy, whom she probably does not know. By what right does she do this ? When a courtesy becomes expected, can it longer be called a coui'tesy ? Does not one get more enjoyment from having the door held for her by having tugged at said ddor in the past ? No, girl?, by waiting for courtesies the joy of their unexpectedness leaves you with an unhappy sense of inferiority and helplessness.

Activities Or Study? With the close of the present semester and the appearance of grades in all subjects, much discussion will be heard over the neverdying collegiate issue of whether the student should devote himself to campus activities or concentrate on studies. It IS hopeless to adopt any standard for campus activities in hope that the student will recieve a maximum amount of benefit from his college career. Whether a student is neglecting his cultural opportunities by such participation depends upon the individual. Some probably derive more good from school by staying with their books, but there are others who, if they did not take part in activities, would leave the institution with nothing to show in the way of culture. If a student has no taste for good English literature or other mater-

This type of person does more good using his talents for contacting other individuals and getting things done. And who is fitted to denote whether a student is capable of being an activities man who will benefit culturally by his status? No one but the student himself, who can fairly estijnate hio own abilities. Overorganization is not the chief evil, but rather the trouble on most campuses rests in the exaggeration of the importance of activities. —G. S.

Greek Trackmen To Hold Inaugural Fieldhouse Meet f raternity track aspirants will a chance to display their abilities in an indoor meet to be held on February 9-10, in the Fieldhouse. Men who are interested should begin training now,' so they will be in form to compete. The meet is being held before the varsity indoor meet, so those who make good records in their events may be able to win berths on the varsity squad. Six of the events will be held each day. Not more than two men from each frstternity can enter any one event except the relay. The events to be run are: pole-vault, shot-put, high jumpy broad jump, 60 yard dash, 220 yard dash, 440 yard dash, one-half mile run, mile run, two mile run, 60 yard low hurdles, 60 yard high hurdles, and the fourman half mile relay. Men who have won major or minor letters in track are ineligible.

Women’s Athletics
Recreation Periods Recreation periods at the Women’s Gymnasium have been well attended this week, according to Miss Veronica Brady of the PEW department. Badminton has been the most popular game duiing finals, but ping-pong, volleybay, deck tennis, and other games are available each day of finals, Miss Brady announced. Swimming Open swims for girls will be held on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons at 4 o’clock, and a mixed swim will be held Friday evening. Co-ed swimming classes will be conducted from Feb. 1 to Mar. 26 by the women’s physical education department. These classes, not scheduled sooner because of an uncertainty in the time of remodeling of the Memorial Gymnasium pool, will be open to sophomores and to freshmen, in that order. Classes are scheduled for Tuesdays and Thursdays at 2, and Wednesdays and Fridays at 2 and 4. Life saving instruction will be offered on Mondays from 4 to 5 p.m.
