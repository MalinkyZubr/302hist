Literary Contest Awards Made At Annual Banquet Robert Frost, noted New England poet, spoke last night at the thirte^th annual literary banquet in the south ballroom of the Union. President E. C, Elliott inti-oduced the speaker. The purpose of the banquet was to honor students who have shown outstanding literary ability during the past school year. Presentation of awards was made following Mr. Frost’s talk. “Perfection” ■
Alpha Zeta Speech Contest Closes As Six Men Compete
During the first part of his speech the" speaker dwelt upon the subject of perfection^ He stated that “the perfection of anything breaks though to its opposite.” To show his meaning he said that in a government the starting point is an ^ absolute monarchy. The plan of government works toward perfection in the form of a democracy and then goes back to its opposite, the original absolute monarchy. Frost told the audience a little concerning the writing of- poetry. He said that the poet has two ways of thinking of the world. The poet may consider life from the tragic viewpoint or from the comedy viewpoint. He then made the stat;ement that life is two things at one time. In the last "half of h;s address the speaker read a number of his poems, including “Birches,” “Mend-* ing a Wall,” and “Paul Bunyan’s
Wife,”
Co-ed Wins Janet Morris, senior co-ed, won both the Governor ToiA(nsend Cup for the be^t informal essay and the Horace G. Reisner cup for the best short story.

ALL STUDENTS 'You are urgently requested not to enter the new Music Hall. The contractors are making every effort to have this structure ready for the dedication opening on the evening of May 3. Lately an increasing number of students are disregarding the “No Admittance” signs, thereby interfering with workmen, especially those in the difficult task of clearing and cleaning. Special guards have been placed in the building with instructions to file complaints against all trespassers. At this critical point in the winning of another Purdue victory may we not depend upon your complete and helpful co-opera-tion ? , Edward C. Elliott, President.

’Sweehearts’ Cast Nearly Ready For Opening Night Performance
By Bob Burstfield Thiee weeks of rehearsal drew near their close last nighf" as the entile cast of this year’s Varsity Show, “Sweethearts,” appeared in full costume regalia, uniforms, wooden shoes, and greasepaint, for dress lehearsal. Costumes, 60 in number, which weie ordered from Tams in New York, vary from brilliantly colored soldier uniforms to little Dutch pantaloons, droopy hats, and wooden shoes. In the first act, natty military uniforms are worn by the men’s singing chorus; a gold Cossack hat, blue coats with gold braid trim, white breeches, and black patent leather mounted leggings. In contrast, the girls’ singing chorus is distinctive in blue and white laundress’ dresses, wooden shoes, and white Dutch bonnets. Colorful Costumes At the rehearsal last night, we discovered that the second act represents a “grande affair.” And in'deed, for take^ a Dutch dancing chorus of girls in, red and white dresses and boys in colored pqntaloons and shirts, add to it the clipp-i-ti-clopp of wooden shoes, a good
Senior Board Members And Junior Executives Selected By Committee Sarry Layson, Pharmacy ’41, and John Van Horn, ChemEngr. ’41, were nominated last night by the executive committee of the Student Senate as candidates for the office of Student Senate President at the election to be held Tuesday, April

Popular Election In the middle of May, eight additional junior Senators will be elected by popular vote of their respective schools according to the apportionment at the same time as the election of eight sophomore Senators. « The reorganization amendment adopted May 2, 1939, by an almost unanimous vote of the Senate ha§ contributed greatly to increasing the ppwer and widening the scope of Senate activities, making possible the presentation of a larger number of student recommended projects for improvement to the
faculty.

supporting singing chorus, and there you are, a “grande affair.” Next we saw the third act go formal in white ties, tails, and white formals. Picturesque, it was, with the choruses dancing on levels. After a talk with Patty Wollcott, costume chairman for the Varsity Show, we discovered that her committee of twelve girls made t\ie blue and white laundress’ dresses that appear in the first act, and also the rainbow colored dresses which clothes the dancing chorus. Looks Good ^ What a show this dress rehearsal promises to be! No other music is as singable or as tuneful as Victor Herbert’s in “Sweethearts.” Witness the songs which you will hum for weeks after you see the show. Listen to the top ranking voices on the campus, sung both by principals and by a well trained supporting chorus. Watch while set units are skillfully changed from a village in the first act to a more formal atmosphere complete with a fountain in the second act. Then admire cleverly designed costumes which appear throughout the three acts. Some show? Yes?

Felix Mackiewicz^ Bbilettnaker captain and third baseman, came through in the clutch yesterday afternoon and saved the Riveter nine from going down in defeat before Monk Kessell’s tough Findlay College outht. In typical Frank Merriwell fashion Mack slugged out a mighty triple with two out and two aboard in the last of the ninth, scor-r ing two of his teammates to put the game on ice.

hits, the Boilermakers took advantage of the breaks to score their fifth win in seven games. Vernon led the Riveters in the batting column with two singles. McFerren, Hearne, and Stamm also hit singles in addition to Mackiewicz’s all-im-portant triple. Endrick Fans Nine Endrick, star Findlay hurler, went the route for the visitors, fanning nine Boilermaker batsmen while walking six. He seemed to have the Riveter batting power well in hand until Vernon and Mackiewicz connected in the ninth. Pitcher Endrick also led the Findlay batters, with two singles. Blanken pitched six innings for the Boilei'makers, giving up five hits, striking out five, and allowing one walk. Higgins took over moimd duties in the seventh and allowed three hits, one run, and one walk. It didn’t take the touted Findlay nine long to get started. Goodish struck out to open the game, but Lather followed with an infield hit. Wolfe sent him to third with a sharp single to center and Findlay scored its first run as Ponzuric forced him at second. Vernon Hits Vernon smashed out a single over second base in the home first and was sacrificed to second, but was left stranded when Mackiewicz grounded out. Neither team could force the issue in the second or third innings and Findlay wasted two singles in the fourth. Findlay counted another run in the fifth. Endreck singled through short; Goodish walked; Mackiewicz muffed Lather’s grounder. Hason reached first as Endreck was thrown out at home. Goodish scored on a wild pitch, then Blanken settled down and struck out the next two batters to end the inning. Riveters Tie Score Smithson reached first to start the Boilermaker fifth as Schlosser booted his grounder. Fisher reached first and Smithson was safe at second on a fielder’s choice. Blanken sacrificed them to second and third. McFerren singled Smithson home with the first Riveter tally. ' Vernon walked and Fisher tied the score as Vernon was forced at second. Mackiewicz- forced Waterhouse to end the inning. Findlay marked up its last score in the ninth on Paskewich’s double and Endrech’s single to put the visitors in the lead 3-2. Endreck seemed to have the Boilermaker batters under control and the crowd began to thin out. ^ Mack Hits Long One Rawles batted for Higgins and took a free ride to first. McFerren forced him at second. Vernon singled McFerren sending him to third. Waterhouse struck out. Mackiewicz came to bat and smashed out a long distance clout that went for three bases and sent McFerren and Vernon across the plate with the tieing and winning runs.

Athletic Honorary Initiates Seven Girls At WAA Cabin Initiation into Purdue Sportswomen, co-ed athletic honorary, was held last night for seven girls. Jane Fishleigh, Patsy McFarland, Jane Stickler, Dorothy Holden, Marjorie Hoover, Marietta Townsend, and Eleanor Harrison were initiated in the ceremony held at the WAA Cabin. A sports spread in honor of the new initiates was held afterward. Requirements for eligibility for membership in the Sportswomen organization include the earning of 1000 points through WAA participation and qualifications based on scholarship and character.
Indiana’s Hoosiers, who slugged their way into second place last year, were upable to go through wdth their scheduled two games with Ohio State at Columbus because , of another of “old man weather’s” whims for a cold spell. Minnesota and Michigan, the other two conference teams, were not scheduled. Two ‘One Hitters’ Pitchers had quite a field day last week with four of them turning in better than 5 hit performances. Milosevich of Illinois and Saxer of Wisconsin approached within one hit of the collegiate hall of fame, while Haub, the Iowa ace, and Pacotti, another Illini allowed three and two hits respectively. Collecting five hits in eight trips to the plate, Clarence Stephan, the Badger’s second baseman, has grabbed the top spot among the Big Ten batsmen. Two more Wisconsin lads, center fielder Schilling and right fielder D’Orazio, have compiled a record of four safeties in eight trips to the plate to remain right on the heels of the keystone sacker.

Will Be Tested This Week Illinois, Iowa Tussle Headlines Card Leadership in the still-young Big Ten baseball race will be tested this week-end when Iowa knd Illinois tangle in a pair of games in Iowa City on Friday and Sa,turday, and Wisconsin journeys to Ann Arbor to cross bats with the Wolverines. ^ Badgers Win Two ■
The Badgers looked like a far different team than that which ended up in sixth place last year as they handed the Chicago Maroons a double taste of defeat, 13-1 and 8-0. The Illini kept pace with the northern lads by taking a pair of encounters from Northwestern, 11-7 and 1-0, arid Iowa managed to st4y on the winning side of the ledger with a hard-fought 2-0 win over the
Boilermakers.

Opposing the Gold and Black thin-clads will bh the Wayhte University st(Uad from Ucttoit. Most formidabll! opw position from the Detroit team is expected to be encountered in the dash and hurdle events. ; Although rather uripredictable, due to the fact that they have as yet fo meet their first opponent this^ season, thri auto-city team' has shown up Well in mile relay events in which they have takeri part. In addition to this strength in thri track events the visiting team also holds
punch in the field events.
Led by Captain Shackletrin, Dave Rankin, and Ed Holderman, virtually the same men who so Successfully faced the Michigan State team last Saturday will again run in the meet this week. All of the local thinlies '‘^re working hard these ^ys is the perfection of their techniques in the various events with RankiUi Captain elect of the football team, and winner of 14 points in the Michigan meet, polishing up on, his discus heaving, while other luminaries of the cinder track are doing their best in chasing around the stadium grid-

Feiier Enters Hall Of Fame With No Hitter
Cleveland’s fireballer, Bobby
Feller, yesterday entered baseball’s hall of fame with a no hit, no run game against the Chicago' White Sox. It was the opening American League game for both teams and
was won by the Indians 1-0. Although the youthful right-
hander was a little wild at times, he had complete coirimand of the Chisox batting endeavors. Taffy Wright, Pale Hose outfielder’, provided the climax to Feller’s performance when he grounded out to the infield for the final out and Feller’s entry into the above-mentioned ,
hall of fame.
Meanwhile, the Indians were fairing little better with the southpaw slants of'Edgar Smith. The Chunky lefty only allowed six hits, but let the winning run slip in on a single and a triple in the fourth inning.
Starting their season> Friday, the Riveter tennis sqriad Will jourriey to Indianapolis to meet Butler. After arriving home on Saturday they will rtieet the W^stetri ^tate Teachers team bn the men’s courts. This gear’s squad is crip^ined by Fred Fuente, who with Jim Hebbler are the only two lettermen on the squad. Last year’s squad, which won seven while losing six, was the best in the squad’s history. Five men will leave for the match which will comprise two doubles and four singles matches. The five men are Fuente, No. 1, Hebbler, No. 2, Ray Lucht, No. 3, Bob Anderson, No. 4, and Bill Berg, No. 5. The doubles will be Captain Fuente and Hebbler the number ones, while Lucht and Anderson will be the
number twos.
Handicapped by bad weather and lack of space in the Fieldhouse, the squad has been unable to work out; consequently, the doubles are inexperienced due to deficiency of prac-
tice.
“Tennis is a major sport at Western State because of the fine material they have,” said Coach LaBree, “this accounts for the reason why they have One of the^ finest college teams.” This year’s schedule calls for 17 meets in addition to the Big Ten meet. They will meet seven Big Ten foes: Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Northwestern, Ohio State, Wisconsin, and Michigan.
Prof. C. Trimble To Speak Before Ap Faculty Meeting Professor 0. C. Trimble of the department of education and applied psychology will be the main speaker at the fourth meeting on methods of teaching for Agricultural Staff members, to be held in the west faculty lounge from 7:S0 to 9 p.m., tolmorrow.

PURDUE EXPONENT
Purdue's Intelligencia And Aristocracy . . . choked the south ballroom of the Union last evening to hear one of America’s bestloved, down-to-earth lyricist, Robert' Frost. We couldn’t squelch the ugly feeling that the majority of the Aristocracy present was somewhat lacking in an appreciation of the words they heard, and that the Aristocracy far outnumbered the Intelligencia, This deplorable situation, in itself means little if anything except that js indicative of the general personality and background of Purdue, both students and faculty. Many references made by the genial Mr. Frost fell upon uninterested and unappreciative ears for the plain and simple reason that Purdue has shut itself off almost entirely from the more cultural and interesting phases of education, and confined themselves too much to the sciences of statistics, the slide rule, and the kitchen, . Great will be the day when the science student, the engineer, and the home ec can graduate from Purdue knowing that Shakespeare

is something more than a “three-hour pipe course,” and that there still is such a monster as a “liberal art.” In sociology class we learn the many phases of a more complete life. Yet what can we do about it? We don’t necessarily have to be a bookworm, sleep with a volume of poetry under our pillow, or let our hair grow long to be an appreciator of the liberal arts. All the majority of us need is the time to do it during the'School day, and the opportunity to include a few li^ht and interesting liberal arts courses in our curriculum. \ \ —R.E.I.
