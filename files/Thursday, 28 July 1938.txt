Summer Prom Ticket Sales Mount
King, Queen Will Be Present At Dance Tomorrow Approximately 225 Summer Prom tickets had been sold last night, as pljans for the summer’s No. 1 social affair progressed under the supervision of Union Manager L. M. Valley. Tickets for the dance, at $2 each, are on sale at the main Union desk 24 hours a day, and will also be available this afternoon at a desk in Exponent’s business office—room F of the Union. Prom promoters predict a total sale of more than 350 tickets, with an estimated sale of 50 tickets at the door on Prom night. Henderson May Broadcast Arrangements were underway last night to put Fletcher Henderson and his orchestra on the air over WBAA for a 30-minute broadcast tomorrow afternoon as a prelude to his playing for Purdue’s first Summer Prom that night. Hank Miller, announcer of the University broadcasting station, last night telephoned the colored “king of swing” at the Grand Terrace, in Chicago, to get his consent to play for WBAA listeners from 4:30 to 5 p. m. tomorrow. Henderson said he would infonn Announcer Miller by telegram today whether he could complete a Chicago recording engagement in time to get to Lafayette for the special program. 11 Tomorrow Is Deadline Although tickets may be purchased until dance time, Grand March Chairman Sully Mason set the deadline for voting on Pyom Queen and Prom King at 11 o’clock tomorrow morning. At that time ballots ■will be counted and the King and Queen notified of their election to terpischorean royalty. Public presentation of the regal couple will be made just before the grand march begins, at 11 o’clock tomorrow night, Chairman Mason stated. Nominees for the position as Queen include: Georgianna Baker, Ruth Bryant, Joyce Burnham, Georgann Schilling, Mary j’ane West, and Kathleen Zollman. King candidates are Jack Dobson, Robert Hensler, Howard Humphreys, Cecil Isbell, John Rumsey, and Bud Taylor. Only purchasers of Prom tickets are eligible to vote. Arranges Decorations Decorations Chairman Ted Cabonargi made plans yesterday to set up floodlights outside north and west windows of the ballroom to provide inexpensive lighting effects for decorative purposes. Physical Plant Superintendent C. D. Bushnell will provide the lights and supervise their installation. Refreshments vdll be served to Prom goers at card tables in the Faculty Lounge and on the adjoining veranda. Manager Vallely announced Tuesday afternoon after a session with his summer mixer subcommittee. Select Chaperones The list of chaperones for the dance, drawn up by the mixer planners, includes: President and Mrs. E. C. Elliott, Dr. and Mrs. F. B. Knight, Mr, and Mrs. R. B. Stewart, Prof, and Mrs. F. C. Hockema, Mr, David E. Ross, Prof, and Mrs. 0. F. Hall, Mr. and Mrs. W. A. {Continued on page 4^
June 1938 Final Exam Copies Now On File At Library Loan Desk Copies of all final examinations given in University courses last semester are on file in the Library, Prof, W. M. Hepburn, librarian, said last night. Students may check out examination duplicates at the Library loan desk, on the second floor, for use only in the building. Casts Prepare Three Dramas For Next Week Three one-act plays, “The Trysting Place,” “At the Stroke of Nine,” and “The Monkey’s Paw,” will be presented in Ross-Ade Stadium next Wednesday evening at 8 o’clock. The various casts of the plays are being directed by students from H. Kenn Carmichael’s class in play production. “The Trysting Place” is a Booth Tarkington comedy concerning a very young man’s family troubles in his love affairs. The cast includes Ira Frenoh, Felix Mackiewicz, Georgann Schilling, Bonnie Swope, Joyce Burnham, Tom Wonnell, and A1 Exton. Nota Misner and Florrie Caldwell are directing the play.
Dr. Gallup Tells How His Institute Determines The Public s Opinion
“We can separate popularity of the candidate from popularity of the issue,” Dr. George Gallup, director of the Institute of Public Opinion, told the 150 staff members and students crowded into the Faculty Lounge Monday afternoon for the summer’s last forum, “We think that is the greatest good we are able to do for the people of the country.” The nation’s outstanding opinion sampler outlined the procedure he follows in predicting results of national and state elections and in determining popular regard of other leading issues. “We’ve never gotten around to believe that there’s any great social good in forecasting 48 hours ahead of time how the nation, or how Kentucky, will go,” Director Gallup stated. “We just show that it can be done.” At present Gallup’s institute is working on Kentucky’s democratic senatorial nomination race, and shows Barkley leading Chandler by a 2 to 1 margin. !
Pybilcation Dates Exponent will publish Summer Session issues on following dates: August 4 and 11,
Care For Material Things Is Worst Defect - Monahan “One of our greatest over-whelm-ing defects today is our care and undmded attention on material things rather than a deeper consideration to the spiritual side of life,” declared the Reverend D. L. Monahan, Fort Wayne, Sunday in a sermon given at the last weekly religious convocation for the Summer Session. “We must avoid class division and become interested in the success of our neighbors,” said the former Lafayette minister. Denouncing the treatment given to religious freedom in many countries of the world, he stated, “The Christian way is successful where it is sincerely tried.” The speaker was presented to the audience by Edward Holland, local Catholic student minister. Dean” R. G. Dukes was in charge of the convocation program.
Fort Knox Soldiers Go On Road March
By Milton Reeves Exponent Staff Correspondent Fort Knox, Ky., July 27 — Only three days remain of our camp period, and I believe I share the feelings of the entire ROTC when I say that I’m glad to see the end draw nigh. Of course, we have enjoyed ourselves and Fort Knox, but six weeks is a long time to be a soldier. Last Friday we got a first-hand impression of how a truck-drawn battalion of artillery functions on a road march. We loaded up and moved out early at morning, travelled a rough and dusty 125 miles.
then pitched out tents in a sheltered woods in the afternoon. That night, for the first time, I had some difficulty in getting to sleep. Usually, after a hard day’s work, all I have to do is to lie down on my cot and I automatically fall asleep. Sleeping in an army “pup” tent, however, with only one blanket between me and the cold, unyielding terra firma, proved almost impossible. Finally, though, mosquitoes stopped their menacing buzzing, spiders ceasing stomping their feet on my blanket, and I miraculously fell asleep.
Most of this last week-end was spent in checking equipment back to the supply sg’t. Also B’try B was occupied in resetting tents mysteriously pulled down at night by unseen forces. You see, both B’trys A and C have lost their guidons and have openly accused B’try B of purloining them. So far, rivalry between the three batteries of artillery has been friendly in nature, but by week’s end it is apt to break into open warfare. The case of the missing guidons promises to supply plenty of added excitement for our last week.
Pufdue Research Improves Railroad Wheels
By Howard W. Blakeslee Service Editor, Associated Press America’s new, high speed railway trains have been reshod with njore durable wheels, it was revealed yesterday at the Purdue University Engineering Experiment Station. Although there have been no wheel accidents, a new safety chapter in railroading had to be written when trains speeded up to 100 miles an hour. At first one long round trip was usually sufficient to necessitate a new set of wheels for superspeed trains. Today a streamliner can cross the continent 38 times on the same set of wheels. Look Same As Ever These “winged heels” of the new rail mercury look the same as ever. But they have been armored, by heat and alloy treatments, against some strange freaks. , Much of the new information came from a 12,000 pound rotor, a huge roller of solid steel, set up in a Purdue laboratory to imitate what happens when brakes are clamped on at 100 miles and more an hour. The experiments were conducted by Prof. H. Rubenkoenig and Prof. D.
S. Clark, of the mechanical engineering school. The 12,000 pound rotor is spun by an engine until its speed is equivalent to the wheels of a fast train. Released by its engine the steel mass continues to revolve. It has the momentum of a real train. Take-AH The Strains A car vyheel is clamped to one end of the rotor. Regular rail service brakes on this wheel are used to stop the rotor. The wheel and brakes take all the strains they would get under a train speeding over the rails. But for the first time, what happens to the wheels is visible to science through thermocouples and other instruments. At the equivalent of 100 to 110 miles an hour part of the steel tire of the car wheel reaches a temperature of 2100 Fahrenheit. This extreme heat covers an area of several inches of the wheel’s rail-contact surface. That area turns glowing red. It vaporizes some of the cast, ii’on brake shoe. A white hot mist of iron streams six feet out behind the shoe. Some of the metal of the shoe is
welded to the car wheel. After such a stop, there are patches of newly welded metal spread in thin coats on the wheel tire. Under this heat and strain, car wheels change their shapes. Their normal forms are like that of a dinner plate. If the edges of a dinner plate should curl upward when a hot potato is laid in the center of the dish, that would be a reasonable description of what happens to the huge steel car wheels. Their rims warp inward as much as a quarter of an inch. Most of this warp comes out when the wheel cools or the strain is taken off. Some wheels, in the Purdue tests, have remained slightly but permanently deformed. Grow Like Leprosy " Another freak of the high speed braking is tj’ansverse cracks across the tire of the wheel. They start so fine that a microscope may be needed to detect them. But they grow like leprosy until a third of a wheel may drop off like a chip. This is the first practical engineering work on measuring the deformation of car wheels in action.
(See Editorial, Page 2) First steps to launcli the University’s extensive year-and-a-half building program -were taken yesterday when plans and specifications for the excavation and foundation of the ney?" Chemical Engineering Building were submittecf to PWA authorities in Chicago for approval. As soon as the plans are returned, the University will advertise for bids on this work, Controller R. B. Stewart said last night. This action represents the opening of construction negotiations on four new University building projects, to cost almost three million dollars. Forty-five percent of this amount was provided by the Public Works Administration in recent grants . . . The University will raise the remaining 55 percent by private bonds. Music Hall Assured Construction of another building—a music auditorium extending southeast from the Administration Building—seemed assured yesterday when the state legislature practically abandoned plans to lop from Purdue’s allotment the $300,000 asked for that purpose. PWA granted $504,000 Tuesday toward the erection of the auditorium, but University officials said this fund could not be used unless the state appropriation was passed. The remainder of the $1,120,000 needed for the hall—about $316,000—would be raised by a private self-liquidating bond issue. Architects are engaged in perfecting plans for a $1,045,545 addition to the Memorial Union Building and for two new Cary Hall sections—the latter of which will complete the residence quadrangle. Grant Made For Union Word of a PWA grant of $474,545 to be used m building the Union addition came last Saturday. A week earlier presidential approval had made available PWA funds for 45 percent of the cost of the new Cary Hall units. Total funds given by the PWA during the past month for building purposes total almost two million dollars and include: Women’s Residence Hall unit, $166,320; two4Sary Hall units, $466,363; Chemical Engineering Building, $271,584; Union Building addition, $474,545; and Music Hall, $450,000. Another federal grant of $201,321 in PWA money was made to the University last Saturday for the development and beautification of the Purdue campus. All Underway By First Of Year Work on all the new buildings will be underway by January 1, Controller Stewart said yesterday, and will be completed within a year—by January 1, 1940—according to PWA regulations. Both residence haU projects and the Chemical Engineering Building, however, are expected to be ready for use by the opening of the 1939-40 school year, in September, 1939, Stewart stated. Next phase of development includes the request for bids on the complete construction of the Women’s Residence Hall unit and the Chemical Engineering Building. Plans and specifications for these will be turned over to PWA officials for approval about August 15. As soon as PWA OK is given, the University will consider bids on these projects, then let the contracts by about September 15. Serve New Demands Expansion of the Union Building will serve increasing demands of Purdue’s large enrollment of students and their extracurricular activities and provide more facilities for use of the public. The present structure will be added to on the north and west sides and the basement addition will extend south of existing building
lines.
Size and facilities of the building will practically be doubled by completion of the Union project. Present investment in the Union is approximately $1,110,000, while the cost of the addition is estimated at $1,045,545.
Judgment Day Draws Nigh
Schedules for the Summer Session final examinations have been prepared and distributed on the campus. Elsewhere on this page appears a copy of the complete schedule compiled according to key hours and examination periods. Three days -will be devoted to finals—August 11, 12, and 13.

As A University Grows...
... in student enrollment and in services to its siipporting state, so must it exjiand its physical equipment to provide facilities for many and extensne functions. When the Memorial Union Building was constructed, in 1922-23, University officials in characteristically conservative manner planned it to serA e 3.000 to 3.500 students—ample accommodation for that time. Enrollment for 1937-38, hoAvever, approximated 6.500 students, and indications point to an equally large, possibly greater, registration this September. When the Unnersily started its dormitory building program in 1928. there Avcre 3 015 men in attendance ... in that year the Cary Halls Avere started Last year. 5.126 male students enrolled at Purdue—an increase of more than 2,100. FirsA unit of the AVomen's Eesidence Halls Avent up in 1933-31 Then Purdue had 642 Avomen students . . but in five years’ time there came an increase of 408 co-eds, so that 1937-38 saiv 1,042 Avomeii attending UniAmrsity classes. Alany and diverse conferences brought 30,814 citizens of this and other states to the campus last year ... to be accommodated by the UniAersity's physical facilities Avhile taking adAmntage of its educational opportunities. The Union's ncAv addition Avill double the present building’s size and means of serAice—to take care of the needs of twice as many students as the original structure Avas fitted for, and to provide meeting and lodging space for the University’s growing list of annual Ausitors. Completion of the Cary Hall residence quadrangle Avill equip Purdue to house about 1,000 men, through use of those units and A'anous annexes. But that number represents less than half'of the increase in men students since first construction Avas begun on the halls. Each Avith the construction of the third unit to the Women’s Residence Halls, room for only 250 additional co-eds will have been supplied since the first section Avas finished, despite the 408 increase in enrollment of Avomen during that period. Living conditions for the Avoinen previous to establishment of the halls were deplorable Purdue’s present physical expansion program is great and extensive, but it IS only in accord Avith the rapid educational groAvth of the institution It does only justice to one of America’s major universities.
Looking Back Purdue Of The Past— July 28, 1937 University officials are still awaiting President Roosevelt’s approval of a PWA grant for the construction of a new men’s dormitory here, according to a statement today by Prof. Frank Hockema, A. E. Kemmer, ’02, local contractor, said tonight that the new unit of the Women’s Residence Hall,

which is to house 80 upperclass women and about 50 freshman coeds, Avill be completed next week. * sk * * Approximately 145 University ROTC men ended this year’s reserve officer training today at Fort Knox, Ky. Cadet E. N. Cox, of the Purdue corp, commanded the entire regiment during final 1937 camp review yesterday. Tonight’s outdoor songfest, starting in Ross-Ade Stadium at 8 o’clock, wUl close the vocal entertainment program of the 1937 Summer Session.
’TIS RUMORED . . . . . . about the campus that there’s to be a bit of a Prom tomorrow night. What a bi’eak for dirt column writers after six weeks of summer school! Anyhow, we’ll be lookin’ fei you, so you better be there. Melvin (Shipwreck) Kelly seems to be quite the lad. Perhaps its his former experience as a sailor or maybe it’s only the influence of his gal. Champ Hauptli, that causes him to carry on so in the stadium after dark. And to think they play football there too! • • ' N Phoughts of a struggling Prom King and Queen: Flutter, flutter—gracious me! My heart goes pitty-pat; To think I have admirers— Now what do you think of that! Later: I could vote for myself— But that’s a poor excuse. For no one else did. So what’s the use? REMEMBER . . . . . . only three more weeks until all the summer school romancers can begin singing “Faded Summer Love.” WANTED: Pockets for formal gowns, (signed) The Eds. THEN THERE’S . . . . . . the story of the school teacher with a name similar to a great actress who went to Wisconsin with the play productipn class for the week-end. She had much fun, but doesn’t remember being helped up the steps of the Wisconsin Phi Mu house in the wee hours of morn. Quite a celebration we hear! LIFE AT COLLITCH Where do we go from here? We’ve drunk up all the beer. Drive off in the car To park—not too far. Ah don’t be so dense, my dear. HAVE YOU SEEN . . . . . . West Lafayette’s contribution to next year’s Purdue male pulchritude? His name is Dick Pittinger and he sure is pretty—tall

Local Team Plays Ross Camp Nine After going through the major portion of its schedule without a defeat, the Summer Session baseball team finally lost its first tilt to the Lafayette Legion nine Tuesday afternoon, 7-4. Tomorrow the University players will try to make up for that defeat when they meet the Civil Engineers at Eoss Camp at 4 o’plock in a game originally scheduled for yesterday, but called because of wet grounds. Since the last meeting between these two teams the Summer Session squad has played two games, winning the first from the graduate students, 6-4, last Friday, and losing the game to the Legion team. Against the graduates, Massoth and Mackiewicz did the pitching while Bartz, former varsity pitcher, hurled for the opponents.

Congratulations: To the Davises, Isbells, Urams, Whites, and Wojciehowiczes. These men would have made the star-studded college eleven without any national poll, in fact many of them knew they were going to play before the balloting even started. —^fc— Orchids: To Blaine Patton ,of the Indianapolis Star, for expressing our sentiments about the manner in which the college players were selected. —fc— Itching sprigs of poison ivy; To the alumni secretaries, athletic directors, fraternity brothers, etc. who voted by proxy for hundreds of people chosen at random from telephone directories just so Johnny Doe, of Kickaboot College, could make the team. ’ —^fc— We are not backing down on some remarks made previously in. this column, but we are denouncing some of the methods practiced by various groups who desire 1;o see their favorites on the All-Star roster despite the fact those favorites are not real stars. —^fc— Purdue baseball is definitely up and coming. Two months ago Harry Krause was catching Bredewater, Heiss, Mangus, etc. Today he is warming up Hubbell, Schumacher, Melton, and Coffman. Art Bredewater, who still can play another year of college ball, will have an extended tryout with the Brooklyn Dodgers in the latter part of August, Bredewater along with Ross Dean and Joe Waling have been playing with the Wichita, Kan., Water Works team. Last week Wichita captured the Kansas state semi-pro tournament, and starting August 14 will be host to the national semi-pro tourney. Felix Machiewicz, Boilermaker third sacker, is swatting the ball for an even ,400 clip in the fast Indiana-phio league.
200 Will Participate In Tonight^s ^Sfunts^
Stunt night tonight, the first exhibition of its kind ever held at the University, will include not only acts by boys, girls, and men who are in summer school or who have been in swimming classes this summer, but also a feature act by Professor Zobo, the great diver. Professor Zobo will dive off the high board into the water and stay under for five minutes. Elsewhere his act has drawn wide acclaim as a near-miracle.

U. S. 52 By-Pass Eases City Traffic Condition Completion of the U. S. 52 bypass has removed much undesirable and unprofitable traffic from the streets of Lafayette, according to a recent study made on effects of this highway branch. J. H. Barth, D. 0. Epp, R. M. Kimmel, N. H. Shea, and W. H. Warrick—four ’38 engineering students—investigated the effects of the by-pass as thesis work, under Prof. G. E. Lommel. Usage of the by-pass is effecting a decrease of 30 per cent in the total traffic passing through Lafayette on U. S. 52. Truck traffic through the city is 58.5 per cent less than it was a year ago.
