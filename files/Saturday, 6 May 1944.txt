At 1 a. m., the Hornet and Enterprise got word .from the Curtiss that a new contact had been made. iiUhiediately, every pilot aboard the car:^iers began getting: his, plane in shape for_ a take-d|f._ PinAlly; at 6 a. m., sixteen scouts were iauhchcd ifrom the Hornet, This was too many scouts, and everybody

At 6 ilO-a. ra., just after the ^Aeputs had ieft, came a message from the Curtiss, Thu enemy had been cdntkcted;agAHi.,: . , :.h ' . ^ ■ The trAgic fact was that the Curtiss had made this contact'at S :3& a. m., but the and Hornet didn’t get the message until two and a half hours later-illustrating one of the worst inefficiencies of the Navy at that time, thp slowness of coding and communication. By the time the message reached the Hornet, the sixteen scouts had taken off, and they
could not be recalled.
However, the boniber pilots climbed into their planes, expecting at any minute the, command, to _talie off, H WAS daylight, and they wanted to hit the eneiny before the enemy discovered them. But
nothing happened,
FinaHy, at “3 a. m„ came the take-off order. By that time, the Japs had already sighted us, and U, S. dive bombers passed/Jap dive bombers in the air. We lost the Hornet,.The Japs suffered some damage but no sjliips sunk. Younger officers were convinced we could have wiped out the Japs, had our pilots got a chance at them two hours earlier.
