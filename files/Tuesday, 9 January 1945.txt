When students begin to exhibit tendencies to b9P the men who are taking foul shots .pn tke ifloor,' then something should be done to stop, this bad display of manners and sports-

T^e referees are men who are appointed to take charge of the game, to see that the fjiles of play are enforced, and to see^ thaf. It . yrhenever an infraction of the rules dddS ofccur, whether intentional or not, then they ]' will enforce it. }■■/' They are only human, and as such the^

^ut it i|n’t the opposing player who should suffpr the consequences of the bad j iidgment of the official. When he is in the act of shooting. a foul shot, the stands should be quiet and allow the player to shoot with a mininium of disturbance. That is good ihahhbrs. Aiid it is also gpod sportsinanship. ^ In the past this type of editorial has come out in print, too often. We hope this will be
