event js bei^g pl@,nned? If suteh a pl^ wefe "religiously followed', the benefit to this entire campus and all its organizations ^uld far out-weigh the effort it tajjes to report plans to the calendar-keeper and'check
i;^4te, tfeere are enough stqdents ijovy to provide an ample turn-out for two or even three events in one evening, but this is most unfair to an event which proves to be the lepser drawing C3,rd. Moreover, when all t|ie Victory Varieties, basketball games, dances, etg., ore jammed into one week-end, dull and liheven^ul week-ends are bound to come be.tw^n. With careful planning, and consideration froto ail the organisations on campqs, gnd a wnll-^ordinated calendaring system, the fun could be spread out. No “eid” is going to be very happy about spending all his money on
three. The l^xponent is willing and anxiops to publish a University calendar as it has been doing in the past. This brings events to the eye of the public, but we think the reol need nojiv is to have a method of bringing dll schedr uledievents to the eyes of an organization at thei time they are p}gniiing a dance, jatliletie event, or convo. Nkturally, each committee, orgnnizgtipn, et '*?planner’' would necessarily have to take the responsibility of looking qp their tentative date on the University calendar in the Office of Student Affairs, and furthermore, that calendar shgujd be complete, ■'formerly, meaning before the war years, th^ calen4ar was completely kept, but th^re geeins to be a general ignprapee on the part
and even the eKistonoe of the fftlehc^, Oonperqtion in repprting events to the calendar and cooperation in checking a date jbei^cHte planning an event would certainly help smooth out these jajnmed-packed weet-^ends.
