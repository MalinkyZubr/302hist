nationalism swept the world. Beople were ready for it, they were ready to ^expand. No longer were they primarily Hoosiers; now they were “Americans”, now they belonged to a much larger and more im-
portant group.
Their rivalry with competing groups was j’ust as fanatical as a feud between high school basketball teams. And better yet; this -rivialiy has the endorsement of the ehtive So-
ciaf group.
But nationalism hasn’t worked either. It'hasn’t solved anything. It'hasin^t helped the common man. I|; hasn’t helped the ecoiiohiic system. It Jias helped to make wars that are built on a grand scale, and it has helped to provoke
