Varsity Expects Strong Competition From Freshmen In Saturday's Tilt Getting their first taste of competition this year under actual game conditions, Mal'^Elward’s 1940 football candidates will take to the gridiron in Ross-Ade Stadium Saturday and face Coach Burham’s freshmen. While not expecting the freshmen gridders to offer the kind of competition the varsity squads from other schools will offer, the coaching staff believes the frosh will be able to put up a good scrap. Preview of Varsity
As"In other year?, the frosh-var-sity game is looked forward to by campus grid fans as a preview of future varsity ability. In this game the varsity has an opportunity to ehow what they have on the ball. The Purdue varsity eleven, emphasizing speed this year, is rebuilding a graduation shattered team. The desire foi^ greater speed was shown when the coaching sthff saw fit to convert Ted Tycocki, senior and outstanding dash man, from halfback to right end. With Dave Rankin on the left wing, it is hoped that the Boilermaker’s forward wall will be much faster. Downfield Blocking Downfield blocking and perfection of timing were other points of emphasis in grid preparation, with Bryan Brock, sophomore brother of Lou Brock, and Hal Schumacher, junior fullback, among the features. Gloom further collected in and around the tackle ranks when it became known that Pete Timperman
and Bill Neff were lost through injuries. If these holes can be plugged successfully, Purdue’s outlook on the football season may improve vdth a fast team. Tickets on sale at Deac’s, Southworth’s, and the Union. Frosh Will Parade To Game Saturday For the seventh consecutive year the Skull-and Crescent, sophomore hbnorary, will sponsor the fresh- ' man parade to the intra-squad football game Saturday. Freshmen with their green pots will gather at Deac’s in the Village and march to the east side stand on the football field. The largest of these parades sponsored by Skull and Crescent was held in 1936 when 85 per cent of the freshman class marched.

'Defense Program Needs Engineers,' Says Dean Potter A serious shortage exists in the number of engineers available for faster industrial production under the present defense program, according to Dean A. A. Potter of the Schools of Engineering. Dean Potter has been spending several days a month in Washington since early summer serving as government con-' sultant engineer for defense agencies. Aim of Dean Potter’s work is to coordinate government agencies, defense industries, and engineering institutions in training and placing engineers in proper places for greatest efficiency. For example, there is now a need for 30,000 tool engineers, and the shortage of trained engineers in ship building and aeronautical industries is severely felt, he asserted.

George Olsen And 'Princes Of Swing' To Play For Union Mixer Friday Night
George Olsen of the bandleading Olsens will be here Friday evening with his Princes of Swing. He will play for the regular Union mixer from 9 to 12 o’clock in both ballrooms of the Union. The usual one dollar price will prevail. Playing his “Music of Tomorrow,” Olsen offers a cavalcade of refreshing entertainment. The orchestra consists of eleven musicians. Their arrangements are subtle without being ihvolved and their music represents a balance between what IS popular because it is the hit tune of the day and what is popular because it is good. Mr. Olsen enjoys the privilege of being the employer of three beautiful women who sing when he crooks his Anger. Judith Wright is featured as a personality singer and pianist, and Jean Blair, coloratura soprano, and Issaelle Miller, rhythm singer, who sings the daf’s popular
ditties. They will also be featured at the Friday night dance. Olsen also features a male vocalist, Lynn Cole, tenor, and “Bachelors,” made up of three members of the orchestra and Cole, the Olsen Ensemble, and Heub Harris, the drummer. His orchestra has performed in such hits as, “Kid Boots,” “Whoopee,” “Happy Days,” “Follow Thru,” “Good News,” Ziegfeld Follies and “Sonny.” He has also had engagements in clubs and theaters throughout the country, including the Waldorf and Pennsylvania in New York City; the Sherman, the Edgewater Beach and Drake Hotels in Chicago. Olsen graduated from the University of Michigan. Following his graduation, he organized an eight piece orchestra in Portland, Oregon.

Jakes was working in a near-by com field when he heard the plane above. It was then several thousand feet in the air. When Jakes next noticed the plane it was cirding the field, coming in from the south west. Pickels was then leaning over the side; the ship was approximately 500 feet up. ’Chute Opens When he jumped the plane was coming into the field from the north west in a steep glide. His parachute opened, but it did not break his fall. Pickels died from shodc and internal injuries. At the hospital his injuries were announced as fractured neck, spine, costal ribs, and a multiple fracture of the right leg. “When I first heard the plane’s engine I couldn’t see the plane. It was too hazy,” said Jakes. “When the noise grew louder I looked up and the pilot was looking over the side. I thought he was going to wave. Dragged By ’Chnte “It was just after that that I saw he wasn’t going to get out of the plane, (At thj(s time the ship was in a steep glide.) But the next thing I saw was the parachute. It opened completely, but it didn’t open ^oon enough. “The parachute dragged him along the ground for some distance before I could get to him.” Jakes was working about 600 feet from where the ship came to rest. Pickels dropped about 200 feet beyond the plane. '’The* ship and .the boy hit the ground at just the same second,” Jakes said. “The ship was going full throttle.’^ (Contmued on pdge 2) Pharmacy Picnic . . . will be held today at Murdock park instead of yesterday as announced previously.

Bold and Black Tfie ^th
lere we are again with what your best friends are wearing and what they will be wearing this year. —wTw— Those co-eds you see dashing toward the Union are not memb^ of the varsity baseball squad. Oh no, they just stole the baseball man’s stuff by copying his cap. You can buy them either in corduroy or flannel in gobs of colors. —wTw— As Michael Hauer swung into a hit jit number, Joan Collens swung out in an intricate step with her partner. She was appropriately dressed in flat heels, a short green wool jumper and a white shirt. If you like the hot and fast jit steps dress for them in flat heels and short skirts. —^wTw— Corrine Reifers will never be late for that SS 29 class or any other when she is decked out in that white hand knit jacket and those red capeskin play shoes. —^wTw— Are you scotch by birth or by nature? Maybe you aren’t either one but you will look keen in clan plaids. If you are the real stuff wear your own clan tarton—^if not, try wearing Prince Charles or some other well known Scotsman. —wTw— The new longer men’s jackets are being worn by the best of co-eds. Some are choosing tweeds, flannels and herringbones in various colors but you will find that tan holds first place now and it seems that it will remain the favorite. —^wTw— Joyce Fielden attends classes in
wine long sleeved sweater with a beige back. The sweater looks pretty spiffy in combination. —^wTw— Betty Ann McCreary (of B & B fame) wears a clever necklace of polished acorns strung on brown silk cord. She wears it with a long sleeved striped blouse of various values of brown. . . . And talking about costume jewelry Elaine Ahren ■#ears a darling necklace of natural wooden hearts and keys. You know, “I’ll give you the key to my heart.” . . . My ma taught me the use of safety pins when I was a small girl but Jeanette Haines has found a different use for them. She has a necklace made from safety pins strung on two black silk cords. —wTw— Co-eds, let’s leave Peg Davis alone with her new hair do. Peg looks lovely in bangs and the long back drop but you might not. If Peg is clever enough (and we grant she is) to think up these clever hair styles, give her credit for them and let her wear them. —wTw—The eds are wearing their bright plaid wool shirts early this year. One young man (wearing the shirt that I wanted to own) was seen on campus in a brilliant one of red, yellow, orange and various other colors. Other shirts seen were blue plaids, various checks and some plain red flannel ones (are they trying to steal the co-eds stuff or is it vice-versa?) —wTw— ’Til next week—good' dressing.
CAAPilot (Continued from page 1) The plane hit first on the right wing, rolling it up under the fuselage; then the ship nosed over. The plane, a S-T Ryan, was totally demolished. Evansville Student The pilot yras a graduate of Central High School, Evansville, and had nearly completed his fourth year at Evapsville College. He came to Purdue July 18 to start his advanced flight training. He took his primary CAA training at Evansville. ^ The l^ody was taken to his home town early this morning. Funeral arrangements have not been completed.
Prof. J. 1. Bray Will Speak Tonight At AIME Smoker American Institute of Metallurgical Engineers has announced an informal smoker in the West Faculty lounge of the Union at 7:30 tonight. Prof. J. L. Bray, head of the Chemical and Metallurgical Engineering school will speak about jobs for graduates in Metallmgy. This is an opportunity for sophomores in this course to become directly acqjuainted with the upperclassmen and faculty.
Bargain flat fifties and stickers advertising “Roosevelt” were sweet shop features yesterday afternoon but conversation centered around'*’ exemptions from conscription. Men with dependents will be given special consideration—and the question was whether or not pinless men will legally have dependOnts. If actualities are considered it should be a way. —B & B— Patty Lakamp, blonde sophomore as yet exempt from the slump, has done nothing so far this year to warrant publicity, but will hear watching. She takes a lovely picture. —B & B— Irmocence in the person of a naive frosh walked into Doc Miller’s office yesterday and asked for something to remove warts. Doc in his best bedside manner recommended amputation. In the middle of the operation he commanded, “Don’t squirm when you’re being' cut.” —B & B— Shakespeare may not have been an authority on medical questions but sure said a mouthful when he wrote, “T B or not T B, that is consumption.” —B & B— We hate to go literary, but looking at Marge Chanel’s glasses calls for something or otherjj^ —B & B— Seniors this year seem to be less virile than heretofore in producing mustaches. The open season will soon begin, but the scrawny assortment on the campus won’t even be interesting. One notable exception can be seen in Sig Nu’s Paul Hamman. He claims shoe polish is on the way out. —B & B— In parting may we wish a little and say that if we had the talent we’d write a song. “In Love with Love” would be a good title. It would be an overnight success if the testimony of some of our former best customers had their way. —B&B— “In the spring a young man’s fancy turns to what the women have been thinking of all year.” Observe and you will see the truth in the above plagarized statement. No?

Eager Fresh Show Stellar Qualities At First Swim Session A group of able and anxious freshman swimmers met good natured, hard-working Dick Papenguth in the confines of the fieldhouse pool yesterday afternoon, and the coach of the Boilermaker Mermen found it quite a task to keep their youthful energies in check. The Rhinies have been working out in the spacious pool in the north campus sports emporium for about two weeks now. About 25 frosh wrill meet in the Fieldhouse at 7:30 p. m. September 25. Initial practice for the varsity will be held tomorrow afternoon at 4:00 p. m. in the pool. All members of last year's varsity squad, as well as last year’s freshman aspirants should report. Versatile Greenies This present edition of the 1944 team shapes up as a star-studded combination on paper and in the water. High school and preparatory school champions are numerous and promise to put swimming near to the top of the upward swing that was in evidence during the campaign of 1939-40. , Assistant track coach, Homer Allen, has issued a call for all frosh and varsity trackmen to report to room 107 of the Fieldhouse this afternoon at 4:00.
Post Picks Rankin As 1940 Grid Star Stamp Auction, Bourse
As the first hint of fall begins to roll around, politics and foreign conflicts take a back seat and football again becomes the prime news of interest. East, West, North, and South fans are anticipating the op- ^ ening games. According to Francis Wallace in the Saturday Evening I^ost, the schools from' the Dixie land should dominate the gridiron this year. Reasons Mr. Wallace, “The South has the boys, because the South is paying for them.” • In his article “Pigskin Preview of 1940,” he picks an All American team and also names the strong sectional teams of the country. In the Mid-West, Ohio State and Michigan are picked as outstanding. In reference to the Boilermakers, Wallace says, “Purdue lost heavily from ripe material and will have a comparatively green outfit. Dave Rankin will be one of the great ends of the year, and Mike Byelene is a fleet back.” He mentions that the Boilermakers should improve after the Ohio State and Michigan games. The Post’s preview All-Americans included on the first team: Ends, Ison, Georgia Tech and Goodreault, Boston College. Tackles: Drahos, "Cornell and Enich, Iowa. Guards: Suffridge, Tennessee and Sohn, Southern California. Center: Mucha, Washington. Backs’: Scott, Ohio State; Harmon, Michigan; Piepul, Notre Dame; and Kimbrough, Texas A. & M.
HOW GOOD IS THE PURDUE team this fall?

NOTICE TO TELEPHONE USERS Students who are dialing three digits and delaying trie dialing of the remaining digits are delaying their chances of securing their connection as there are many paths to select any given number. This method is absolutely of no help in getting a busy number, but rather a. hinderance. Indiana Associated Telephone Corporation
