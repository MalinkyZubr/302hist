By Clint Sowards '‘Piggy” Laitlberti Mskfetball mentor at the helm of Boilertfiiaket hardwood pbrfo'rnfiefg fbr tho last quarter of a century, has left behihd him a coaching record undisputed as the greatest ifl basketball history.' AiftOng “Piggy’s” scores of all cOn‘feritide ball players-,' bis nine conference indiyidital scoring efiampions, and eleven Big Ten Conference championship teams, “Piggy” has developed and graduated off the Boilermaker floor five men who gained the title of all-American, 'Mui^hy'Fir^ \ ti ' ’ ■■'■ '• 'y- ■ ■
PURDlJiBMKeTMLI^HlSTORY Coii^et'eiice All Gdtrtes
Wi This All-American stuff all started back in 1929 when Less Gage, at that time sports editor of “College Humor’? magazine, published na
school was Jewel Young in 1938. Young was a local boy, hailing from Lafayette, and he made him-
tionally the first recognized All- “J' home over at the
AmeiHcan basketball squad; ^Stretch Murphy (six and a half feet high and a foot wide) repre-
sented the Boilermakers on that first
honorary squad. Stretch was only a junior when he made the sqtiad
Fieldhouse. In his thi-ee years of varsity competition Young set two conference scoring recm-ds, the later of which still stands, and be holds the scoring record for three consecutive years of. conference
in 1929; so it wasn’t a surprise to Young set a new rec-
many people when he again received the honor in 1930, his senior year, even though he didn’t re-earn the conference scoring record he had held the year before with 145 points. Perhaps part of the reason for the Boilermaker’s perfect season for conference competition in 1930 (the only one the Boilermakei's have ever, enjoyed) Vva.s' that Stretch Murphy’s teammate, Johnny Wooden, a .sophomore on the squad also earned for himself the All-Ameri-can; rating, Forty per cent of the all-Americans in the country playing, bn the same team .should have
ord with 172 points; then proceeded to shatter this the next season with 184 points, which still stands as a conference scoring record for, a 12 game, schedule. The three year scoring record that Jewel set ;in ’36-’38 still stands at 465 points.!.

should laud him as the. greatest basketball coach in the country? There is an old saying to the effect that talk is cheap, so let us stop ^talking and supply a little proof for such a broad statement. Where could one turn for proof if not to the record that Lainbert coached Boilermaker teams have compiled Jn cage competition. Piggy’s success against all comers has brought about the slogan, “In case of doubt pick Purdue,” in midwestern basketball circles. Such a degree of success oyer a period of some twenty-four completed seasons of competition beai’s ample evidence of any claims that anyone might make for Ward Lambert’s right to the purple toga among the hardwood coaches in the land.. Here Since ’16 This mighty mite, a graduate of Wabash college, took charge of the fortunes of Boilermaker hapdwood teams in the fall of 1916. He came hepe after six successful years as coach at Lebanon high school. During the season of 1917-18 Piggy did his part in the first world war. He returned from the service three days before the 1919 season got underway and took charge of the" team. This was too much of a hanclicaj) for even Piggy. His team finished in the second division that year, and ho must have felt very much out of place there. Only one other Lambert coached Riveter team .has ever finished in the second division, and that was last year’s team which was handicapped by injuries, lack of height.
and inexperience, Some Changes Made With the coming of. the ;1926’.S came the golden age of ,B.oilbrmaker basketball. " ; ■ , Lambert - copched ca^e. .teama have won or shaped the tie' ll, times, six tlm'i^ these %ere\Undjig-. puted crowns; Eour'times the'Riv.*. eters have been runners-up, ahd' their all time percentage,;of Vie-^ tories is. over' .700. Against nqp-. conference foes the Lambtartmerf have an.averafje that is eVen better^ so that; shdWi! ‘ that they play no favorites wheh'it comes to.winning ball games. His teanilf, (are winners because they are bettef’ coached, and bette'a conditioned than their opposition! and that is probably why they have been so suCceipful. They use no particular system of set plays, fbr any set offe.ns;e has a countbi’,f balancing defense. They just know; what to do arid, how to do" it. .... ;

When Ke would slide'down ’ the; hillsy the stocking eap stuck .straight out behind him, leading to the .name “Pigtail.” After a. short time the name was shortened to the present form of “Piggy.” Thus came into existence the famous name which is known throughout the country. Ever since. Piggy with his great Purdue team.s, has been steadily gaining, speed. And it has not been downhill like his old sled either.

Piggy Lambert Adds New Zest ' ToDr.Naismith'sNetCreation
By Cob Krieger. Piggy Lambert, in growing up with the game of basketball, has seen it develop- through different phases. Teams had been cut down in size from 9 men to 7 meq, and then to 6 men when he started playing, but he has pa.ssed through all the experimental stages of the dribble. Primitive rules When Piggy first started playing, it was against the rules to use. both hands on the dribble, which, it can easily be seen, gave the defense a big advantage, for the dribb^r could not shift the ball from one side to the other in attempting to elude the defense. Another rule change found the dribbler prohibited from shooting. A player could dribble down the floor to his heart’s content, but he was forced to pass the ball to a team mate, or throw it against the bank and recover the ball on the rebound before he could attempt to try for a field goal. This again turned the tide in favor of the. defense, for the dribbler lacked a scor* ing threat: Fast Break Lambert’.s teams, fundamentally, are drilled for a “fast break” offense. In other -words, when the ball is recovered off the bank, the Boilermakers rush down the floor like the rnembers of a volunteer fii'e department, attempting to get the offense .underway and secure a shot at the basket before the defense can. gather its full force. The “fast break,’.’ of course, has
been modified by Piggy front year to year, dependent upon the material available, but he is a strong believer in trying to score as soon as possible once you secure control of the ball.. Long Passes Too Iri some years, Lambert's teams used a long pass to get the fast break xmderway, with an otrtstanding backguard capable of handling rebounds without much help. In other years, Piggy built the “fast break” around a speedy dribbler of the immortal Johnny Wooden type, Lambert, of course, does not use the “fast break” exclusively. Occasionally his men operate from a slow break, with players going in ahead of the ball for set formations. Spectators Benefit In , addition to resulting in the winning of the Big' Ten championship many times. Piggy Lambert's uncanny hardwood mastenninding has also resulted in making the game more wide open, thus providing more enjoyment for the spectators.

ip .nearly every sport played with a ball. .That is, the idea of the defense, which is the case since the ten second rule went into effect. New Idea

Riveters Tackle... (Continued from page 1) gy Lambert’s 25-year Boilermaker hardwood calendar, the Riveter coach will be honored by the student body with the pre.sentation of gifts in recognition of his silver anniversary at the Old Gold and Black hardwood helm. Every player who has performed on the Boilermaker hardwood during Piggy’s long and successful reign was invited to attend tpmor-' row’s celebration, and a whole host of them have already sent word that they will be present to pay tribiite to their coach-. A. special section in the Fieldhouse has been reserved especially
for Piggy’s friends. A few of the galaxy of notables who will witness tomorrow’s clossic contest from this location are the following: H. Vv^.

Joe Behna’s Boilermaker boxing team found the gloves flying a little too fast for them last Week when they invaded the camp of the Mdrray State Teachers’ College in Murray, Kentucky. The lads from the hill country, coached by Jim Moore, showed superior class in.defeating Benna’s boys. Quite a surprise was sprung by the Boilermaker’S on their southern jaunt. In the 176 pound class, Murray’s captain Steve Kowalsky, bolded of a three-year undefeated record, was beaten for the first time in his collegiate career by Don Elfin, Benna’s scrappy light-heavy. Boughan Wins The only other vietdry was the bout won by the Boilermaker cap-' tafn, Gus Boughan who smothered Danny Stephens in the 155 pound class. Needed experience was gained by the Purdue punchers in this meet and Coach Benna is confident of a decisive victory in the coming meet with St: Joseph College. Summary Complete results of the Murray meet is as follows: In the 1.35 class. Prank Alexander (P) lost to Smiley Larson (M). In the 146 class, Stan

Warilk. (I*iggy) taiiibert • A ^dfii’ter of d cefithr^ as head Coach of Purdue basketball has built up around Coach Ward Lambert a series of stories that are sitiiiilar to the myths about the heroes of the days Of old. Stories about his enthusiasm on the bench, about the AVay which he takes care of his team during trips, about the way he sat on the bench of ^amSs when he was so sick he ne'(rer Should have been out of bed, about arguments with his old rival Dr. Meanwell, of Wisconsin—and SO oh and on. Of the hundreds of stories we have heard about Coach Lambert, there is one which was told to us the other day that, occurred Several years ago that stands out before all the others. To us it depicts the real Piggy Lambert. It goes something like this: Approached By A Panhandler While walking down the streets of Lafayette Piggy was accosted by a shabbily dressed stranger who gave a sad tale of hard luck in asking for the price of a meal. The stranger was young and sincere, and Piggy was so impressed by his account that he listened to the entire tale that the youth had to tell. He immediately forgot where he intended to go and brought the man Jiack to the Pieldhouse. Here the boy was given soap and towels to take a shower and clean up. Took Him Home For A Meal The Boilermaker coach next took the boy to his home. As he was about Piggy’s own stature, he gave the boy a complete set of new clothes. It wasn’t an old worn out suit that he gave, either, but one with plenty of use in it yet. Next the ycung luan was given a good meal, his first one in several days. After slipping a couple of bills in the boy’s pocket Wax'd Lambert took him back across town and bade him goodbye. , He Has A Heart As Big As A Balloon To us this story shows the size of the heart which beats under Coach Lambert’s well-fitted spoi'ts coats. It’s as big as a balloon and solid gold. Atz (P) was downed by Curly Mat- Miller (P) lose to Mike Nicholas hews (M). Eddie Ryder (P) lost to (M). The vietoi’ies wei’e Gus BougJim O’Rourke (M) in the 165 di- han (P) who won over Danny Stevision. Virgil Nicholas (P) took phens (M) in the 155 class, and Don Stan Bennett (M) at 175 pounds.
