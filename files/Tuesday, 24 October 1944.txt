Honorary organizations were first insti*tuted to recognize talent, service and give credit where credit was d,ue. But they did not remain thus for long, because campus cliques soon organized into effective pressure groups. The control of honoraries passed from the hands of idealists into the hands of realists who knew well the pfrinciples of power politics. it was that non-partisan organizations became so multi-partisan that to belong to an, honorary bespoke of political as weir as dtheP abilities. ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ That time has not passed. While we of the Americas are frantically decrying the deplorable use of the principles ci'Tbialahce of power in Europe we blithely ^dorse it here, even in such petty politics as are in campus hohorafies. " t^oiitics on the campus are not used so much to glorify personalities as to perpetuate control of influential organizations as a l^sanpa to some; particular ^rbup. It does not matter whether that group rates a monument or not, for its industrious politicians wl^wPtk hatd to insure its immortality. ‘ |)Jirty in powbr is always hated most its potential succt^sor which hopes someday. to be .able to control the organization. Would-be dictators are always more angered by dirty politics of the reigning party than afe the minorifies. ^ ’'^e minorities know they haven’t goli a chance anyhoW. For them it’s just a question of the lesser of two evilSi of the weaker of two giante, and they prefer the weaker. '
