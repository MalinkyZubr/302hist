' . ^ But whethct for or against Hoover, ther^ is no teal arghraent, among tho^p who have .Watched thc.whedls ' go round, about the fact that. EtoOVer has been the mainspring of the Dewey campaign. ' RebreS'Cntative Cllare Luce of Connecticut -got a sample of this just before GOP leaders met recently in. Chicago to organize for the Republican conven-
