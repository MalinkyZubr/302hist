Of Hruby's Plea As Firsf Day Sale Ends
Exceeding $2,000 worth of business during the first two hours of business yesterday, the student book exchange had taken in more than $3,000 by the end of the day, indicating the turnover of approximately 3,000 books. It has been found by experience that books average somewhat over a dollar a piece in value. According to Vincent Hruby, Union executive in charge, 600 students were waiting when the doors opened at 10 o’clock yesterday morning. Fifty-three clerks serving the exchange were kept busy until noon taking care of the first rush. Books Needed '
Due to the great volume of business the first dajr, the shelves are nearly empty. Books of all description are needed. Those in possession of old text books that are in use this year are urged to bring them in as soon as possible to help meet the demand. Money for receipts will be refunded beginning Friday. A list of all books sold will be posted Friday in the ballroom to facilitate refunds.

. . . CE ’27, who will play for the double-header mixer Friday and Saturday nights.
Kizer To Address ROTC On Corps Day
Calls for freshmen co-ed and ed editorial workers will be made at a later date. This call for sophomores includes all sophomores who have worked on the paper befgre and all sophomores who have not worked but are interested in finding out just what Exponent work is like. No Experience Necessary No special abilities are required for an Exponent worker. The main qualifications are a good knowledge of English, reliability, and a ready sense of humor. Experience gained from other journalistic or managerial positions is welcomed but not necessary. Nearly all of the present workers have gained their working knowledge while on the staff of the paper. As you probably know, the paper is published every week day except Monday during the academic year. This means a staff must work every night except Sunday. The sports staff does its work in the Fieldhouse office; the editorial and co-ed editorial staffs, in rooms D and E of the Union Building. Work Requirements Work on the editorial staff consists in gathering the facts, interviewing campus personalities, writing the stories and featiires, writing headlines, and having a good time. This work well done may lead the worker into such managerial positions as junior editor, junior sports editor, or junior co-ed editor. These junior positions combine responsibilities and opportunities to learn how to handle fellow workers, and in turn may lead to senior posts. Exponent work has always been classed as worthwhile experience, and has been known to favorably affect employment upon graduation. Although it is generally acknowledged on the campus that the Exponent is one of the hardest student activities, the staff knows it to be one of the most congenial. Don’t Forget To Come Journalism carries with it an air of importance and excitement that even the routine news of a college campus cannot dull. When you come to the meeting tomorrow, bring your schedule cards, and your sense of humor.
Noble Kizer, Athletic Director; Mai Elward, football coach; A. P. Stewart, director of campus musical organizations; and Colonel Beere, professor of military science and tactics, will address the assembled members of the University ROTC today at Corps Day. Cheer leaders will be on hand to lead the corps in cheers and to help make the exercises a sort of pep session. Basic students who have not yet acquired a complete uniform will wear civilian clothes to Corps Day instead of the parts of the uniform that they have, according to a statement by Colonel Pickering.

On Passing As Heal
Tie
Cancels Scrimmage
Louie Lowe, CE ’27, will return to the campus tomorrow night with his band to play for a double header mixer tomorrow and Saturday. Both affairs will be held in the ballroom from 9 until 12, and are open to the student body. While in school, Louie was active _____________________________
With Jack Brown ambidextrously flipping passes off of both shoulders, the Boilermaker football forces yesterday sweltered through the heat waves in a pair of secret practice sessions. The versatile sertior halfback, who tosses the pigskin around with either hand, displayed marked improvement in accuracy and may easily develop into the most effective passer on the squad. In addition to Brown, both Lou Brock and Mike Byelene, veterans, and Johnny Galvin, sophomore, showed Coach Mai Elward that he need have no fears about the efficiency of the Boilermaker aerial attack. Galvin, who hales from Chicago, was Bill De Correvont’s main rival in the Windy City circles. •
A tie between Jesse M. Shaver and H. F. Hays for representation of the sophomore Civils and Public Service Engineers will be broken at the next meeting of the Senate according to Herb Fishbum, president. Out of a field of 59 candidates, 19 were selected by sophomores and juniors in three days of balloting at a booth in the Armory.
YWCA Will Sponsor Student-Faculty Tea This Afternoon
Freshmen and their counsellors will be guests of honor at a tea for co-eds given by "YWCA this afternoon at four o’clock in the Women’s Lounge of the Union. Freshmen and upperclass members will have an opportunity to become acquainted with each other and also faculty members at the tea.
Weather Halts Scrimmage
In view of the unreasonably hot weather which has settled down around the Boilermaker camp, Elward cancelled plans for actual scrimmage during the afternoon session. Instead, the time was utilized to good advantage in an intensive workout on fundamentals and dummy scrimmage. A great deal of time was also spent on perfecting the aerial plays, with the aforementioned passers doing most of the pigskin tossing.
Competition Among Guards
It has become evident from the brisk workouts so far, that ^ome spirited competition has developed for the starting guard assignments. Both Prank Bykowski and Carl Verplank, veteran last year men, are being pushed hard by Jack Winchell, junior letterman, and a trio of likely looking sophomores, including Tom Melton, John Brown, and William Donnelly.
Discontinue Double Drills
. . . pledges of Chi Omega social sorority were initiated Saturday, September 9, at the chapter house, 402 Waldron Street. The following girls were initiated: Mary Henry, Gary; Eleanor Poor, Etna Green; Barbara Fellows, Chicago, and Elaine Wellington, Oak Park, 111.
With classes starting today, it has become necessary for Coach Mai Elward to discontinue the practice of having twoi drills daily. Blut with the squad working behind locked gates, away from unnecessary distractions, Mai feels sure that every minute of practice can be utilized in preparing for the season’s opener with Notre Dame.
Miss Clare Coolidge and members of the advisory board consisting of YWCA townswomen and faculty wives, will be at the te^ today to advise the new co-eds. Freshmen women are urged to consult the board during this time. Catherine Cooley, president of YWCA, yesterday announced that Mary Ellen Scarff will be in charge of a booth where co-eds may obtain membership cards. Dues for the coming year" will be $1.00. YWCA membership gives eligibility for elective and appointive offices in the organization, which promotes the participation of all co-eds in many interesting and valuable projects. Ruth Wattleworth, chairman of the tea, has announced that pamphlets will be disti’ibuted telling about YWCA and naming the committees for the 1939-40 season. Through©,iit the year, YWCA will sponsor Sufiday Vesper services, also inspirational and educational talks by faculty members. The first Vesper service will be held on September 17 tit 5 o’clock in the Women’s Lounge of the Memorial Union.

THE PURDUE EXPONENT
Thuisday, September 14, 1939
Jimshf. JoJUl Lesson Number One: The First Day Of School Today is the first day of school. You must have known that, either by reading about it in the University bulletin, in the Student Handbook, or by listening to current r'umors. Remember, however, that you can’t always believe campus gassip 100 per cent! We hope you take a good look at your classmates today . . . the chances are that you may not see ttjem all together again at one time until final examinations... that is, unless your class happens to have a picnic or a free dinner on the professor. It’s important that you make a good impression on your professor. First impressions are always important . . . and there are sixteen weeks of school remaining this semester. Knowledge of a good impression should at least make you feel good, and it might even effect your grade. But if you fail to make a good impression, don’t let it worry you. There is always room for improvement... and, of course, there are sixteen weeks of school remaining this semester. Today is the first day of school. Wasn’t it?
Statistics Show Grad's Employment Survey of the employment of graduates of the last two years leads to the comparison published below. The most noticeable emplo3ntnent increases have been in the mechanical and chemical engineering schools with 25 and 20 per cent increases, re-
spectively.
Total graduate employment has increased over eight per cent over the employment of last year’s grads. Because of lack of contact with a few graduates, the percentages may, in a few cases, be slightly misleading. STATUS OF EMPLOYMENT CLASS OF 1939, JUNE 11,1939 (Compared with Class of 1938)

Many weddings of former Purdue students took place in and around Lafayette this summer. One of the loveliest was that of Miss Martha Love Wood, Sc. ’39, to Clifford M. Hardin, Ag. ’38, of Knightstown, in Lafayette, Mr. and Mrs. Hardin will live in Chicago, 111., where Hardin will study for a doctor’s degree at Chicago University. Miss Helen Lange, H. Ec. ’42, was married to E. Robert Pape, Jr., M. E. ’38, on July 31, at the Central Presbyterian Church in Lafayette. The bride was a member of Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority and the bridegroom, a member of Delta Tau Delta fraternity. The home of Prof, and Mi s. Ralph B. Wiley, 600 Bexley road. West Lafayette, was the scene of a June wedding when Dr. William Graham pf Central. Presbyterian Chufch read the services for their daughter. Miss Ruth Mitchell Wiley, H. Ec. ’39, and James A. McClintock, Sc. ’38. Announcement is made of the marriage of Miss Ellen Boyd, H. Ec. '41, and Ralph Morris, Sc, ’38. Rev. Macklin of Crown Point Methodist Church read the ceremony. Miss Sylvia Kahn, H. Ec. ’41, and Leo Brodsky, Ph. ’38, were married in Chicago, 111., with Rabbi Joshua Libman officiating. Miss Martha Alice Brown, H. Ec.
Right on the heels of the Exponent announcement of WBAA’s extensive sports broadcasting schedule comes an announcement from Chicago that NBC will open its football broadcasting season with a play by play description of the PurdueNotre Dame game with Bill Stem at the mike. Starting at 1:45 September 30, the game will be carried by the Blue network. e e Speaking ot football broadcasts, we have just heard a vei^y sad story. Dick Shively, WBAA sports staff head has just informed us that he will not be able to go on the air himself to cover any of the football or basketball games on his Monday, Wednesday, Friday sports program. Outside influences have caused this change and nothing can be done about It. (Confidentially, it’s the old feud between the press and radio.) This is certainly a tough break for Dick as he had just completed a summer’s work making possible the coverage of all Purdue games by WBAA and also putting out his sports booklet. Dick has a good future ahead of him in radio if he can follow it, many people have said that he will soon be ready to take Russ Hodges’ place. e e Due to this change in the sports staff, there is now a position open for a person able to give a running description of ball games. Anyone interested should call the radio station at 6076. e e This afternoon at 3:30, a program that should be of interest to students will take the air over the Voice of Purdue. It features Glenn Paxton at the electric organ in Fowler Hall. The program was started shortly after summer school adjourned and received quite a bit
at the home of the bride’s sister in Denver, la. The bride, who has been doing graduate work at Purdue for the past three years, is an assistant in the institution management department. Mildred Jeannette Whitesell and Joseph John Seale were married at the Alpha Xi Delta chapter house m West Lafayette. The bride, who is a member of Alpha Xi Delta sorority, attended Purdue. Mr. Seale is a 1939 graduate of Purdue.

This year’s cheerleading squad will continue to perfect new routines for the various functions at which they will perform.
