A Museum ...
At sometime during the development of nations and communities, someone usually louses in the onrush of progress long enough to collect items of historical significance for if future generations. Everything and,any thing g that might represent a phase of development or the spirit of the day is gathered into a ■ collection and given the name — museum.
IpS
tended to industries, colleges and even fami'f lies. The'University has now come of age; it needs a museum. , About the University there are many items ; ; which should be put into a collection to porl^ay our history. Progress has made much ; of the equipment obsolete, and as time passes ,V ^things become museum pieces, which show ' * as nothing else can the develophierit and pro- ^ 5 gress in many different fields. 0/' w 'fhere are a few misguided people who la- \ ' bel such ehterprises as museums as “useless and a waste of money.” It is these peo-
pie who have no regard for the history of human progress. They do not seem to realize
' \ that we learn of the present and the future
* by examining the past. If museums are so
f.^ useless, why do multitudes bf peo^e cibnt Imue to flock to the metropolitan museums
m; for a pleasant Sunday afternoon.
I' ' Economists agree that lavishnesS'on the
part of everyone is necessary for a prosper-
.fj ity. The planners of sixty million jobs are ' counting on an increase in consumption of aU
t^es on the part of the American people^ >. Surdy we should not deny ourselves a museum because a few say it is a waste bf money,
f A museum has the unique property of in- / creasing in value with the passage of time g - rather than depreciating. This atone khould
justifying its undertaking from a monetary
j;' point of view.
For these reasons, we propose that the; University include in its post-war plans spme I xHTovisipn for a building to be desi^ated as I , ' , the Purdue Museum. Into this mqseum would i« ,, go the small historical collection begun about j - the campus now. Apparatus from the first “ \ ^ laboratories and all types of obsolete equips ment could go into this museum. The nbtebooks used by famed alumni would be of I - / more than passing interest, and models and > , pictures could recreato our early history, j » One wing of such a museum building could " be devoted to the locomotive museum which I .. is how rusting away in its shed by the power I ' iriant. It is indeed tragic that such a famed , ' ’ coUectibn as this should disintegrate into
^ ' a junk pile.
, Raders' Digest gives the University credit ' for a nqn'existent museum. In the November , ) . issue in an article about Doc Wiley, the Pure
Drug pioneer, it was stated that
I the high wheeled bicycle, which the Doc rode f A,', campus when he taught here at
: 1^ turn of the century, is now on display in I Purdue'jS museum. Actually the bicycle, the
