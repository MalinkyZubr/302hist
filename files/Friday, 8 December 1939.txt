You Put The Steam In Here; The Turbine Goes 'Round And 80,000 KW Come Out
By John K. Bryan
Considerable interest has been atti acted the last few weeks by a mo(|el of a turbo-generator on the secdnd floor of the mechanical laboratory. This model, which is to the scale of one twenty-fourth, has been loaned to the University by the Milwaukee Electric Railway and Light
Company.
The actual unit is the 80,000 Kw. installation ip the most efficient steam power plant in the world, the Port Washington station, which helps supply light and power to Milwaukee, some thirty miles south. In the turbine, steam at a pressure of over 1,200 pounds per square inch is passed through 73 rows of blades, the last row of which is revolving at a tip speed of over 600 miles per hour! The steam admitted to the turbine is at a high temperature (825 degrees P.). Consequently, if
the machine were shut down and allowed to stop revolving before it cooled off, the heavy shaft would “warp.” For this reason the turbine rotor is siowly revolved after it has been taken off load until cooling is completed, which may be after 60 hours. An idea of the great weight of the unit can be had by noticing, from the model, the massive struc-
ture supporting it.
Direct connected to the turbine is the generator, delivering power at 22.000 volts, and with a capacity of 80.000 Kw. In other words, this unit can produce enough power to keep over a million 76 watt lamps burning. And here’s how efficiently it does this: out of one pound of coal fed to the furnace, enough electrical energy is delivered to the switchboard to keep one of these 76 watt lamps burning for about two-
thirds of a day.
By Rolfe Jenkins, Exponent Sports Editor Western Illinois State Teachers’ College of Macomb opened the Boilermaker basketball season at the Purdue Pieldhouse last night and put up a courageous battle but fell, 47-24. An onslaught of baskets which came in two spurts by sophomore Forest Sprowl and junior Bob Igney, forwards, provided the main scoring punch for the winners. Sprowl made five field goals in the first period while Igney made one, but Bob shot four more through the net in the first five minutes of the second
half.
After the Riveters were tied 1010 in the first period they swiftly pulled away from the Macomb quintet, and led at half time by seven points. Ten men saw action in the first half for the Boilermakers, with the Igney, Sprowl, Weber, Tierney, Beretta combination which opened the game carrying the brunt of the
work.
Ceres Club Opens Essay Contest For University Students Ceres, agricultural honorary, is presenting an essay contest, inviting all students who are interested in agronomy to enter. The contest is open to all students of the University, and will be divided in two classes: Freshman division for freshmen, and Upperclassmen division for sophomores, juniors and seniors. Winners in each division will receive a silver medal for permanent possession and the Ceres Essay Cup to keep for one year. Second place winners will receive bronze medals.

Tuttle To Describe Color Photography “Color Photography,” a comparatively new field for amateur photoglaphers, will be the subject of an address by H. B. Tuttle, representative of Eastman Kodak, when he speaks before members of the Camera Club tonight at 7:15 in the faculty lounge of the Union. The speaker, considered an authoiity on color photography, travels throughout the country taking color pictures for advertising purposes. On display will be natural color prints from Tuttle’s collection. This will be the first display of actual color prints made on the campuH The addiess tonight will be a prevue of what will be common practice in the amateur photography field a few years hence. Prints of this type are made by a complicated process, not as yet in general piactice. At the conclusion of the formal address, Tuttle will answer questions of any type concerning the photographic field. Alpha Chi Rho . . . social fraternity announces the initiation of the following men: R. C. Beer, Mansfield, O.; H. E. Bollwinkle, Ridgefield Park, N. J.; W. L. Gaulke, Hales Corner, Wis.; G. E. Hamilton, Oak Park, 111.; H. S. Hawkinson, Cedar Lake; V. E. Hump, Chicago, 111.; R. A. Kuntz, Indianapolis; D. W. MacMillan, Bedford; R. L. Sqiith, Franklin; J. A. Starkey, Oak Park, 111.; K. J. Thompson, Mansfield, 0.
Playing More . . . than half the game, John Tierney, from St. George high school in Chicago, and Forest Sprowl, Oblong, 111., both sophomores, started at guard and forward, respectively. Other new men in the game were Conrad, Korshot, Red Caress, and Neutzel. Jim Bosse, who led the scoring in last year’s game with Macomb, but who saw little action last year, also played a few minutes. Bishop, Macomb forward, started the visitors out in the lead with the first basket of the game, but Sprowl tied the score with another push shot as he was falling away from the net. G. Willard pushed one in ala the erstwhile Gopher guard, Rolek, from far out on the floor. Eight More . . . points were added in quick succession .by Sprowl, Igney, Beretta, and Sprowl, Igney and Sprowl each hitting a looper from the side, Beretta throwing in a long one, and Sprowl taking a long pass to put one in from under the basket. With eight minutes gone the Boilermakers led 10-4. G. Willard stopped the spree with a free throw, and added a basket. Bishop’s looper from in front of the basket and a free throw by Fulks tied the score again at 10-all. Fisher dribbled in to hit from tmder the rim, and Sprowl made his fourth basket of the half on a rebound a minute later. Fulks’ free thiow made the score 14-11 in favor of the Gold and Black. Sprowl then dropped in his fifth and last field goal of the first half, Fulks shot in a rebound, and Yeager and Herschelman each added a basket to give the Boilermakers a 20-13 lead at the half. Lambert Started . . . the second half with the lineup which opened the game. Weber opened the period with a rebound shot but Fulks retaliated with a one-handed-flip shot which made the score 22-15, Purdue. In the next four minutes Igney made four baskets and Tierney one to lift the Boilermakers into a 17-point lead, 32-16. Free throws by Lewis and Fulks were traded with a Beretta basket and a Yeager free throw to bring the score up to 35-19. Yeager tried three rebounds before tipping one in, and a few seconds later added a free throw. Fisher dribbled in for another basket. Mincemoyer missed a free throw but took the ball off the backboard and shoved it in for two points. Neutzel Threw ... a long one-handed shot in, and Fisher added two more free throws. G. Willard’s rebound basket on a shot by Lewis and Fulks’ free throw gave the Illinois team its last points. Bei-etta looped in a long shot and Herschelman hit a free" throw just before the game ended, with the Boilermakers aJxead 47 to 24. Next on the Gold and Black schedule are DePaul here on Monday and Deti'oit hwe Wednesday. (Continued on page 8)

Charm
Well, now that the Gimlets have .made all their little lads tui'Ji their yellow sailor hats right-side-out, things are getting a little less complicated around here. In the hat situation we mean. Already we are beginning to recognize Silver Mask boys as Silver Mask boys and not Gimlet pledges.
The Mask boys did us a good turn. Until their silver trimmed pate covers appeared, we weren’t aware of this ominous campus trend. Hats to the left of me, hats to the right of me, hats. Hats, HATS! ... and one on my head. Already the Reamers, Gimlets, Gold Peppers, Skull and Crescent, and Silver Maskers are breaking down that old belief that college students go bareheaded. To say nothing of the frosh. If this spreads to any other clubs—and we’ll bet two dollars to the hole-in-a-donut that Doc Miller is pushing the I-want-to-wear-a-hat contingent as hard as he can from his niche in the Exec building—complications are going to arise.
It will be interesting to see the campus big shots rushing from class to class and from activity to activity precariously balancing four or five hats on their heads. Could we offer a suggestion? (As if you could stop us). We say split it up. Let us branch out into the entire line of clothes. We already have a start with senior cords, jerkins, letter sweaters, etc. Perhaps a day will come when seniors will have a complete “activity” wardrobe.
Get up in the moiming, slip on your underwear and then begin on your activity clothing. Put on that “political party” shirt—^that is, if you didn’t lose it in the last election. Then step into your senior cords. (We’re taking this from an ed’s angle as we do not know too much about dressing women). Pull on your AIChE sox (nylon), tie your Hiking Club shoes, and run to the closet for your “P” sweater and leather Sen^e jacket. Grab your Reamer hat and dash to class.
. . . according to dictionarj^ definitions, is a mental as well as a physical quality. A person who is thought of as charming is usually a person whose mental facilities are very alert, is one who knows what is happening, what people about her are interested in and what to do in a ’ certain situation. Of course along with these characteristics, a charming person is one who is well groomed and dressed to suit her tj^e of personality. With these ideas in mind last fall, WSGA and YWCA inaugurated a Charm School. Meetings, held several times during the semester, were open to all campus co-eds. The programs given were aimed to assist and direct girls in their attempt to be more charming. At a number of schools throughout the country are now employed full time grooming or personality consultants who work with the college girls during the year. As yet the size of the co-ed population on this campus and the funds available do not merit a “charm teacher” on our faculty. So we have compromised with the next best thing and are this year continuing the charm meetings. At the first session of Charm School this year, ideas on an ideal co-ed were discussed by prominent senior activity men. Next the co-eds were invited to hear a talk on grooming, and at the third meeting campus etiquette was the topic for consideration. Advance plans show that the YWCA-WSGA Charm School will continue its worth-while efforts in trying to make the Purdue co-ed a more attractive, better informed person. Charm School has already earned its reputation. It is up to this year’s coed population to take advantage of the opportunities it offers.—G. S.
But 'when you leave for school, don’t forget your Activities Bureau muff!!
Then there’s the story of the football player who was so well subsidized that his parents sent THEIR laundry to HIM.
The same applies for the girls, with a few changes. We expect that your organizations can get a bit more intimate, so we won’t mention what WSGA, YWCA, or WAA might furnish. It wouldn’t show anyhow.
We can see those old folks now, pawing eagerly through the brown case in search of fudge, apples, or cookies.
And crabbing about a lost sock.

Your editor has had many requests to publish the poem which opens and closes WLW’s Moon River program heard every night at 11:30. Glenn Merriam, program coordinator of the Nation’s Station and former Purdue man and WBAA staff member, has supplied us with it. “Moon River” A lazy stream of dreams Where vain desires forget themselves In the loveliness of sleep. Moon River, Enchanted white ribbon Twined in the hair of night Where nothing is but sleep. Dream on—sleep on— Care will not seek for thee Float on—Drift on— Moon River to the sea.

Moon River.
The annual radio poll conducted by the Cleveland Plain Dealer has revealed interesting results. Charlie McCarthy was voted the favqjcite radio personality, with the Chase and Sanborn Hour the favorite program. Bing Crosby is the favorite male singer of popular songs

You promised me we would keep on together forever and ever, and now you say we should break up. Why? Are you getting tired of me? If you are, let me know and I will change for you. I love you so much, Dicky, and I wouldn’t know what I’d do if you and I broke up. I think you have met a girl whom you love more than me—probably one of those co-eds. Oh, Dick, if I could, I’d go to Purdue, but as you know, father says I should keep on going to S. D. N. Please don’t fall out of love with me and try not to hurt me so in your letters.

Ohio State Buckeyes Lead Big Ten In Statistical Records Ohio State, this year’s Big Ten champions, not only piled up the best won and lost record but showed their superiority in
outplaying their opponents statistically.
Sparked by the dynamic ;play of ii^i ■
Scott and Langhurst, two stellar backiield men, the Buckeyes scored 166 points in six games, an average of 26 points a game, to top the Western Conference in scoring. They were superior in net yards gained from the line of scrimmage with 1,760 yards compared to Minnesota's” 1,762. The golden toe was prominent in the Buck camp with 18 conversions, two field goals, and an average of 42 yards per punt. Ohio nosed out Minnesota in first downs with 76 and 76, respectively. The passing team of the year was Indiana. Led by Hursch, sensational passing wizard, the Cream
and Crimson completed 44 out of 89 attempts, rolling up 663 yards for a total of 23 first downs. However, they were penalized 201 yards for infractions of the rules. Supported by the brilliant playing of Franck, speedy halfback, Minnesota’s Golden Gophers illustrated their vaunted power by piling up 1,447 yards by rushing for an average of 241 yards per gaiixe. Chicago, the only consistent team in the Big Ten, let her opponents gain 1,090 yards by rushing to rank at the top in this department. Harmon, Michigan’s shifty all

The Wolverines were runners up toJ)hio in total Scoring and despite Harmon’s excellent showing Michigan slipped to fifth position in the final standings. Iowa, surprise team of the year, finished second to Ohio State in the final ratings. These iron*men played sensational ball, and led by Nile Kinnick, were in the thick of the fight all the way. Kinnick, triple threat left half, played every minute of six consecutive games to lead all backfield men. While they did not excel in any particular phase of the game, the Boilermakers played consistent ball thri^ughout the season and finished in third place behind Iowa. The Riveters played very clean ball since they were penalized only 100 yards in all five games. /-M Schedules SQUASH Todav Court 1— 7:00—Phi Kappa Psi. 8:00—Phi Kappa Sigma.

Annual Aquacade To Feature Stars
Kiefer, Rawls, Aspinal, Griswold To Perform In Fieldhouse Pool
Brock Accepts Bid To Play In Annual East-West Grid Tilt Eleven eastern football stars have accepted invitations to play in the annual East-West charity game to be played in San Francisco on New Year’s Day, among them three outstanding members of Hoosier elevens. The eleven members selected to date have been the choice of the co-coaches of the Eastern eleven, Bernie Bierman, head mentor at Minnesota, and Andy Kerr, of Colgate, Indiana 'Trio The first member of the Indiana trio chosen is Lou Brock, Boilermaker backfield ace, who has been one of the most outstanding triple threat men in the IVIiddle West during the past three seasons. Brock, who hails from Stafford, Kansas, is a good passer, open field runner, and an excellent punter. The remaining two members of the three men chosen from Indiana are Notre Dame stars, Steve Sitko, at quarterback, and Bud Kerr, an All-American end. Both men have played outstanding roles in the Irish attack during the past two years. Kerr captained the Notre Dame team for the 1939 season recently ended. Other Members Other members of the East team who have accepted invitations for the New Year’s game are Walter Merrill of Alabama and Ed Kilman of Temple, both tackles; Mel Brewer, guard and captain of this season’s University of Illinois team; John McLaughry, fullback and captain of Brown University the past season; John Haman, an outstanding center from Northwestern; Dick Cassiano, and Ken Kish, halfback and quarterback from Pittsburgh. This year’s game will mark the third in which Bierman and Kerr have coached the Eastern eleven. In all three games the opposing mentors have been Major Biff Jones from Nebraska, and Babe Hollingbery of Washington State. The first year, 1938, the game ended in' a scoreless tie. Last year the Western team came through with a 14-0 victory to assume a one-game mar-
gin.
However, the entire East-West series extends back for fourteen years, with the Western Elevens holding the upper hand with eight victories, while the East has won only* five. The first game of the series was played in 1926, when the Westerners emerged with a 6 to 0 win. '*
Featuring a quartet of nationally known swimming stars and many campus aquatic performers, the annual Dolphin-Triton Aquacade will present a varied program for Boilermaker swimmipg fans next Friday and Saturday evenings. The big attractions on the all-star program will be Adolph Kiefer, backstroke ace; Katherine Rawls, all-around performer; Patty Aspinal, girl breaststroke champion, and Larry Griswold, veteran comedian of two World’s Fair Aquacades. Backstroke Champ
Kiefer has had an unusual career as a swimmer. At the age of 16 he set three world’s records, swimming the 60 yard backstroke in 27.9 seconds, the 76 yard back in 43.3 seconds, and the 100 yard back in 59.7 seconds. In the 1936 Olympics he won the title of world’s backstroke champion. Last summer he Won the national open backstroke championship and the individual medley. Just a month ago Kiefer returned from a trip through South America with an American team which won all its meets. Kiefer, as usual, won every one of his events. Eaefer swims all strokes well, as is evidenced by his individual medley championship. To further prove his versatility he took a place in the 220 yard free style in the nationals. He now holds the world’s records in the 100 meter, 150 yard, 200 meter, and 400 meter backstroke events as well as in all the intermediate distance events. All-Around Star Katherine Rawls Thompson holds or has held the women’s title in almost every event in national competition. She sWims in all events, distance as well as dashes, and dives with the best. Katherine placed second in the Olympic diving competition and fifth in the 100 yard free style. She holds the world’s record for the women’s individual medley. Return Engagement Thirteen-year-old Patty Aspinal made her first appearance on the Riveter campus last year. At that time she clipped 7 seconds off Katherine Rawls’ record for the 300 yard breaststroke. Patty has been under the tutelage of Dick Papenguth, present Boilermaker swimming coach, since she was nine. She holds the national record for the 200 yard breaststroke and claijns for several other records are before the NAAU Records Committee for approval. She is one of the few women swimmers who can maintain the grueling fiying breaststroke for long distances. Veteran Comedian Larry Griswold wowed the crowds at the Chicago and New York World’s Pairs with his combination of comedy and gymnastic performances. He was one of the featured
performers at Billy Rose’s Aquacade this year. Late last summer he toured England and presented his comedy diving before the critical English crowds. With room for approximately 700 spectators, the Dolphins and Tritons, campus swimming honoraries, will present two performances of the Aquacade next Friday and Saturday evenings. Boilermakers Win
