BuUetin! Entrlcs From Over State
To Compete In 4 Divisions Program, Starting at 8, Free to Students; Afternoon IPrelirhiharies Are Open To Public
Number 196 Ws the lucky number as Staff Sergeant Robert W. Shackleton of Font Dix opened the national draft lo^ery in Washington last night for registrants of July 1. One of the nation’s first draftees, Shackleton was accorded the honor of drawing the first capsule by Navy Secretary Frank
Knox.
Knox drew the second numbef which was 98, and Under-secretary of War Robert Patterson drew 451 for the third.
Draw Master Numbers ForJulyl Registrants; Lists Posted In 10 Days Last night in Washington, Secretary of the Navy Prank Knox reached into the fish bowl and pulled out the first of 800 numbers to be drawn in the second national selective service lottery. This new series of numbers will be assigned to the 760,000 young men who have reached the age of 21 since the first registration date. There are 254 registered in the local board No. 2 which includes West Lafayette and Tippecanoe county. Information from the local board officials indicates that the new numbers drawn in the Id^ttery last night will be integrated with the numbers drawn last fall in a ratio of about eight to oi>d. It is doubtful if any of the men holding numbers in this last lottery will be called to duty before September 1, although there is a group of approximately twenty men scheduled to be inducted from this board on August 1, local officials said. Draft board officials stated that it will take about ten days for the master lists to arrive from Washington and for the new registrants to be integrated with the old. After that the regular draft procedure of classification and physical examinations will begin. Registrants interested in finding their status in the draft shoud first obtain their serial numbers from the draft board and then after the new registrants have been integrated with the old they may find out what their actual status is in regard to the other men in their board. Underwriters To End Course Tomorrow The short course in life underwriting which opened last Monday continues today with the discussion of the two vital topics of “Organized Sales Presentation” and “Plans and Purposes of Life Insurance.” Approximately 100 men are attending this basic course in life underwriting which will be followed next week by a more advanced course which will be open to all who have satisfactorily completed this basic course. Licenses Ordered For All Bicycles; No Co-eds On Bars All bicycles ridden within the city limits of West Lafayette must have license plates according to a statement from city fathers, lliicense plates may be obtained at the city fire and police station on Northwestern Avenue. When plates are obtained the color, serial numl^rs, description and all other pertinate details of the bicycles are,recorded. Plates cost 26 cents per bicycle. There is also a ruling which forbids cyclists from riding their kid brothers, or girl friends on their bikes. In other w^ds only one person on at a time.
j Instrumentalists, choral groups, soloists, and baton twirlers from every section of the state will vie for honors tomorrow as the annual University Music Festival gets under way in the afternoon; The stage of the'Music Hall tomorrow night will be the scene of the final performances by the afternoon winners, with Lanny Ross, lyric tenor, appearing as the featured guest artist of the evening. The doors of the Music Hall will open at 7:15, and performances by the state winners will start at 8 o’clock. All students will be admitted without charge upon presentation of registration cards, and general admission tickets will be 75 cents for adults and 25 cents for children, 12 years and under.

' Thfe University Festival one of the Various preliminaries to the final contest at Chicago August 16. Winners will sing before nearly 100,000 persons in Soldier’s Field. Judges for this year’s University Festival comprise one of the most outstanding groups ever to serve here, Albfert P. Stewart, festival director said yesterday. Voice judges will include Esther Goodwin, Chicago contralto who has appeared frequently in Grhnt Park ebneerts and soloist on numerous occasions with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra; Charles LaBerge, of the voice department of the American Conservatory of Music; and Vassie Darnell, U teacher and coach of voice in Chicago. Instrumental and Baton Contests The instrumental and baton twirling contests will be in charge of Joseph M. Ragains and will be judged by Ragains, Marshall Howenstein of the West Lafayette Public Schools, and B. A. McAdams of the Jefferson High School faculty. Statistical proof of the national fame of Lanny Ross, is the consistently high place he has won on country-wide popularity polls during the past season. Typical of the regard in which Ross is held as a radio and concert star was a recent poll conducted by the New York World-Telegram in which Ross was ranked third among the most popular male singers of the country, being topped only by Bing Crosby and Kenny Baker.

As Exponent Defeats Pillrollers Workshop Tomorrow
Doc Miller and his Pillrollers, erstwhile champions of the consumptive league, were completely demoralized last night as the Exponent team easily won the semiannual bowling war on the Union
alleys.
Miller kept consistently to the , gutters throughout the match, and although the other members of his team turned in good scores, the match was never in doubt after the doctor bowled his games. The Exp6nent team, captained by sob-sis-ter Jane Yeoman, included Stuckey, John Traugott, Don Powers, and John Willsey. Stucky the star of the Exponent team, turned in scores of 180, 220, and 210. At the other extreme was Doc Miller who dribbled out a 102,108, and 123. Before the match Miller had said
that he was confident of victory and that his office in the health service would be hung with black crepe if the Exponent ever beat the Pillrollers. The Exponent forthwith presented him with 16 yards of Sears and Roebuck black crepe. It will decorate the health service of* fiee^ today, the Exponent feels certs(in because the doctor is a man of his woijd. After the match Doc muttered something about bringing out an opposition campus daily, and accused the Exponent of fifth column work in appropriating the services of Stuckey, who used to win matches for the Pillrollers. Nevertheless, there weye many witnesses to the match, and Pillroller defeat was un(Continued on page 2)

During the two week period the educators have taken up the various problems of school administration and educational techniques. Director of the workshop is Dr. Paul Rehmus, formally an instructor in English at the University, and now superintendent-elect of the Maywood, O., public schools. ' He has been aspiste<^ by H, L.

4,000 See Fleming's 'Evening of Magic' In Hall of Music A. P^Stewarf Direcl-s Audience In 'Sing' By John Amos Starting his show three-quarters of an hour late. Dr. Paul Fleming, magician, nevertheless, kept an audience of nearly 4,000 entertained for about two hours last night in the Hall of Music. His repertoire included, everything from making handkerchiefs disappear and-reappear at will, to growing a small rosebush from a pot of “rich black dirt from India.” To prove that the rosebush was real he picked the roses and threw them to members of the audience. In traditional magician’s style he succeeded in finding a rabbit in the coat of a small boy and then in changing it into a bag of candy for the boy to eat. To discuss a magician’s tricks after they have been performed is like telling about a movie, it’s fun to talk about but dull to hear, so let it su%ce to say that Fleming seems an adequate successor to the late Houdini, Alexander Hermann, and Harry Kellar, as magicians, extraoi’dinaire. An unscheduled Commimity Sing, directed by A1 Stewart, University choral director preceded the performance of Dr. Fleming who was detained by a late train. The audience sang, and whistled, “In the Good Old Summertime,” “Let the World Go Bye,” “I’ve Been Working on the Railroad,” “Funiculi, Funicula,” and “Love’s Old Sweet Song.” Stewart called Charlay Powell out of the~audience to sing a chorus of this last number. Preceding the unscheduled part of the program a film showing the manufacture of sheet steel, Ibeams, seamless iron tube, train rails, and wire- was presented in technicolor. The picture told complete story of the dependence of our American civilization on steel for everyday uses as well as the uses in heavy industry. It was furnished by the U. S. Steel Corpora-
tion.
Unlike Houdini who believed in spiritualism to the extent that he promised to come back and talk to his wife, Fleming claims that all spiritualism is fake. However, the second part of the program was (Continued on page 2) Elliott, English Staff ' Attend Conference President Edward C. Elliott and members of the English department have had an active part in the three weeks’ conference for teachers of English in technical schools Which is closing this week at the Univor* ^ sity'of Michigan at Ann Arbor. President Elliott opened the, conference with an address on “The Literature Program in the Engineering School from" the Adnainistrator’s Point of View.” Professot H. L. Creek, head of the English department, served on one of the i committees in charge of the confer-
ence.

Other papers were given by Professor Emerson G. Sutcliffe on “A Teacher f of English in an Engineering CoT- J lege Asks Some Questions ” and hy> ! Professor George S. Wykolf on ‘ “Problems in English ComposiUon; The Reading Problem,” . . Other University Enghsh deptiiximent members who attended conference were Victor E. Gibheos^ Raul Fatout, and J. H. McKee.

Keep The Fleet In The Pacific! The mining pf Manila and Subic Bays in the Philippines, and the fall of the Japanese Cabinet, are but two of many signs that the Far East crisis is approaching a show-down. Japan has made new demands in Indo-China, recalled, shipping, restricted the Kobe base, protested American delays in clearing ships. Russia has mined her Siberian waters. The United States, Britain, and the Dutch East Indies are holding important consultations. The natural reaction of Americans, who have been warned so often before that war with Japan impends or that everything depends on a Tokyo Cabinet shift, is to keep their fingers crossed. But just because we have escaped before, we may not always be able to laugh at the “wolf-wolf” cry. The long advertised GermanRussian war missed schedule many times, but it finally arrived with a bang. Therefore the United States Government is taking emergency measures at Manila and elsewhere, just in case. As fo rthe Tokyo Cabinet collapse, most Jap-

anese politicians today are only fronts for the militarists and terrorists in the saddle. They used the strong Matsuoka as foreign minister, just as they bossed the weak Prince Konoye as Premier. Even if liberals and anti-Axis men are named to the new cabinet, their policies and even their lives will be at the mercy of the military dictatorship. Certainly the United States will not provoke war in the Pacific. Now, more than ever, this nation needs and wants peace there. In our judgment, retention of American naval and air power in the Pacific will do more than anything else to prevent war—regardless of British demands in the Atlantic, and regardless of Japanese Cabinet changes.—Indianapolis Times.

given over to pseudo-spiritualism. He produced ghost writing on a sheet of glass suspended between two chairs, and built a box of screens for spirits to play tambourines in. During this part of the program he also blindfolded his wife and had her add numbers which he pointd to on a blackboard. The last act on the program was a maze of mistaken identities. Fleming tied one of his assistants in a bag and put him behind a screen. A policeman appeared to stop the inhuman treatment, but when everything unwound the policeman was Fleming, the magician was his assistant that he had tied in the bag and the person in the bag was his wife.

compromising and undeniable. After winning the first game with a 768 total to the Exponent’s 722, Miller dragged his team down to a 705 and 700 on the next two games while the Exponent was registering 810 and 753. Miller rolled against Janice Yeoman, who in various ways accomp^lished miracles for the Exponent team and thus repaid one debt. Three times sob-sister Yeoman set the doctor down with a lop-sided defeat marked up against him. Despite the d.... dest effort of Messrs. Goodwin, Willis, Mackey, and Weitkamp, Miller always suc-
ceeded gloriously in bringing his team out second best. Spokesman for theJExponent team said last night^Stat it was to be expected that Dr. Miller would deny minor parts of this story and thus attempt to discredit the Exponent, but every member of the Exponent team expressed a willingness to meet the Pillrollers at any time before any witnesses.
