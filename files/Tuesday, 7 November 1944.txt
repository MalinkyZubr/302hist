At thje start pf another new semester in the University, we would do well to be reminded, that many new freshmen from, all over-the coifntry receive their first impression of Purdue as a working organization 'trough registration. And what is their impression? Certainly not the impression of a smooth working organization, for which tibe University should stand, but rather they are impressed with the confusion of a system which teems with complicated methods andi! i»e1ficient practices. And’ is this necessary? Certainly in this dhy of time and motion studies and reforms,. Restate University should be? willing to view the- situation as it is at worst and. make Perhaps the current registration will be regarded as an abnormality because an unusually big .job was meant to. he done jn half the time due to homecoming weekmid^ but we should not take refuge in this excuse. Past registrations have been equally nerve-wracking, and ilfs time for some revamping'of the horrible systemi. The best example of inadequate manageipeht was evidenced in the registration set-up 6f the home ecoWmics school. All day. a steady stream of baffled freshman- women poured into the home ee aisle, where Some found' it necessary to wait as long as three hpUrs before a schedule could, be worked out under the supervision of a, faculty member. But that wasnot the worst. .When these same students went to secure cla^ cards, they

HUIman Would End: PAC
becauae^ two staff members were dis* tribufEing’ cards for ali 'course^ in the home ecoiLomics.schoiDl'. M the FEW' table two staff members attempted to pass out class cards to all freshman, sophomore; and. junior women who must take physical education. AM that’s why it’s time for a change. ; Certainly, this problem is not too big for the effici^cy-minded of the University. Part of the Si^ution seems to lie in providing a larger staff of assistants for registrationj.esj^iaily in the home ee school. Another suggestion is to make more adequate provision - for students who are fordSad to register last in-the registration period. We wQuld:do well to study the registration methods of other univerdtiqs and revise our time-worn, complicated system, while there’s, still, hope for future registrants, ‘ k-a.b. :
