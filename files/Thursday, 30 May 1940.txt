Consecutive Year
here last February.’At that time he predicted that Germany would not win a military victory through the west wall. “I am not afraid of a Nazi victory at all,” he said, “but I am afraid of a stalemate war out of which will ultimately come Bolshevism in Central Europe.” 22 Years In Europe The speaker has spent 22 years in Europe, formulating first - hahd opinions on world affairs. He has written numerous magazine ar-
ticles.
After the Russian Revolution Wolfe entered the USSR with the Herbert Hoover relief commission to aid in reconstruction work. Before the outbreak of the present war, he traveled in Central Europe as a free-lance correspondent for

Elliott gave notice of the seventeenth consecutive winning of the title “excellent” by the University ROTC Corps in its annual national inspection held on May 9 and 10. “Purdue ROTC unit has again attained highest rating of ‘excellent’ as a result of annual inspection.

Ellio#/Knight Discuss Summer Session Values^ Opportunities
To The Student Body: There are certain individuals in the University for whom the winter season is their “winter of discontent.” Their discontent comes from the desire and the effort to provide ^or a dioming more “glorious” summer. So again, there is now presented, as the record shows for the twenty-eighth time, the results of this preparation for the summer activities of 1940. This program is intended for those having the foresight and the ability to strive for that more complete training and skill with which to swing open the doors of opportunity. It will, it is hoped, serve as a guide for those who are determined to go up and farther; and for those who have their own winter of discontent and who anticipate the summer glorious. Purdue University, to an increasing extent, is on operation throughout the entire year. Scientific research and the widespread extension teaching naturally are continuous enterprises. More and more the campus teaching departments are on a twelve-month basis. The old-fashioned summer vacation is almost a thing of the past. Wise economy imposes an obligation to secure the maximum use of the manifold facilities of the institution. Only to a limited extent and for a limited number of persons is the University Summer Session a lei-sure-time activity. On the other hand, it is chiefly the time and place for serious, intensive labor-time effort. The offerings are provided to students, graduate students, teachers seeking to be better qualified for their professional services, and others who realize that education is a process that continues throughout life. Yet it must be insisted that the element of leisure is not unimportant when reckoning the profits of study during summer period. Then the student, freed from many of the restrictions of the curriculun^ leading to a degree, has the chance for intellectual adventures, and for an
However, the Summer Session Exponent will carry on with papers twice a week throughout the month of June, and weekly thereafter. Approximately 2,000 students are expected to attend summer school this year, and the Exponent will cover their activities plus those of the students at the Civil, Forestry, and military camps. In addition, the multitude of short intensive course enrollees will take up their share of Exponent news columns. Subscriptions At the University, papers will be distributed free of charge, and for those who are away, the Exponent will be mailed for the sum of 50 cents. Subscriptions may be obtained in the Exponent business offices, from any member of the business staff, or by calling Dick Rectenwald at 3301.
Dear Purdue Student: The Summer Session of Purdue offers to you and to your fellow students a wide choice of required and optional courses. If you can use the next months most profitably to yourself by study, Purdue is prepared to serve you. Never have students prepared for their life work under more uncertain conditions. Never has it been clearer that basic preparation of future citizens will prove crucial to themselves and their country. All of us are clearly called to make the most of ourselves. For some of us there are better ways of investing our time and energy this summer than by University study. Many students will be making this summer serve their needs and fulfill their duties by work in important industries, needed help at home, and in other ways. But for few of us (if any) is this summer a proper time to play and loaf. Life may have been like that in the past and may be like that again, but not now. This summer the classrooms of Purdue will, as always, be captained by first class instructors, dealing with material of first class importance. This summer is a first class opportunity for you to forge ahead in University work. Practically every facility of the campus will be open to you. This letter asks the direct questions: Would study this summer be a good bargain ;for you? Woujd it pay you ? Catalogues are ready for you, if you desire to read them, and let any of us on the staff help you if we can. F. B. Knight, Director of the Summer Session.
Faculty Members
In addition to regular classes, many special courses will be offered. Among these are to be fouild a short course in rural leadership, a rural youth training school, a fraternity officers training school, and educational leaders’ clinic, a house mothers’ training school, a music leadership training school, a short course for drug clerks, and a rural life-underwriters training school. The house mothers’ training school, enthusiastically received at its first appearance last summer, will run from June 17 to July 12 and will deal with philosophies, counseling problems, house management, psychology. Another infant among the special courses is the training school for fraternity officers. In it, presidents, treasurers, and stewards will receive instruction in the solution of problems pertaining to pledging, etiquette, record keeping, purchasing, and maintenance. Recreation To balance mental work with physical, the Women’s Gym and the Fieldhouse will offer their facilities throughout the summer. Intramural tournaments have been planned and “Games on the Green” will be held on specified days. Professor M. L. Clevett of the Division of Physical Education for Men and Professor Helen W.' Hazelton of the Department of Physical Education for Women will be in charge of this recreation.
There will be a special meeting of the faculty in Stanley Coulter Hall Thursday, June 6, at 4 p.m. A full attendance is expected. Edward C. Elliott, President.

"When No One Is Looking" ... is just a short clause but upon its meaning may rest your future. Last fall the student-faculty committee for the promotion of honesty in student work published a small handbook which clearly defined dishonesty both from the faculty and the student viewpoint. This handbook was distributed to every student in the University. We are now in the midst of final exams and many of the admonitions printed in the handbook may have been forgotten, but may we remind you that these regulations are still in effect. You, through your representatives on the committee, made these regulations because you realized that there is no substitute for honesty, that there is nothing to replace it when it is gone. During the next few days there may be several moments '*when no one is looking.” Be careful of these moments! Your conduct during these times marks you either as honorable or dishonorable not only in the eyes of the faculty but also in the eyes of your classmates.
Symphonies Sale Reaches Peak As Closing Day Nears Closing day for the music appreciation symphony sale has been set at June 6 by the committee in charge. Through yesterday 1774 complete symphonies had been sold, and Schubert’s “Unfinished Symphony” and Beethoven’s" “5th Symphony” led in the totals. According to A. P. Stewart and Prof. F. D. Martin, co-chairmen of the committee, sales have exceeded expectations for a city of this size and reached a peak yesterday. Over 60 percent of the purchases to date have been made by students. Any ope of the ten sjrmphonies that have been released are now available. Personnel Notes

The formal program will be over by four o’clock each day, in order that all may make the fullest use of these t facilities. As all enrollees in the training school will be housed in the Cary Halls, officials in charge believe that there will be many opportunities for smaller group discussions. ^ Meals will be served in the residence halls, and sessions of the school will be held either in the residence halls themselves or in nearby buildings. y Anyone holding an office in a fraternity is eligible for admission to the school. Fraternity presidents, treasurers, rush captains, and stewards are particularly invited.

Bodden, University chief accountant and assistant controller; Dr. G. Herbert Smith, Dean of Instruction, DePauw University; Dean ^ Fred H. Turner, Dean of Men, Unif versity of Illinois; and Miss Georgann Schilling, ex-Co-ed Editor of the Exponent and author of Pardon Me, etiquette book. ' High School Sfudents Will Inspect Campus W. C. Branaman, Purdue grad- ^ uate and now vocational agriculture teacher, will conduct a sight-seeing tour of the campus for approximately 60 students from Salem high school on June 4 and 5.

From 10 to 10:50, A P. Stewart, University director of music, will teach choral interpretation and repertoire. Miss Hill, director of music, Senior High School, Anderson, will instruct in choir and chorus training and organization during the third period.

Should the United States have to mobilize, many of its Army officers will come from the ranks of college men, and a draft would call undergraduates at an early stage. Long a subject of controversy in legislatures and in bull sessions, the advisability of military training on the campus assumes new significance with
war again in Europe. Most Extensive Poll
In its most extensive research poll the Surveys has yet attempted, iuterviews from coast to coast were assigned to ask this question of a mathematical cross section of collegians representing every institution of higher learning in the nation, “Do you believe ROTC military training—either compulsory or voluntary—should be taught in colleges and universities—or do you believe it should not be taught at all?” The Surveys found approval everywhere, with these varia-
tions :
1. Although a good majority are in favor in every section of the
country, the largest number of dissenters—one fifth in each case— was found in the East Central and
West Central states.
2. Only 4 per cent more women than men are opposed to the ROTC. 3. Military training is most popular in schools where it is voluntary, least where it is not taught
at all.
4. Of students who approve, well over half believe it should be vol-
untary only.
The national tabulations are as
follows:
OF ALL STUDENTS, THESE:
Approve
Disapprove
Men Women Both
87% 83% 86% 13 17 14
Of those Approving, These Specify: It should be voluntary . 68 It should be compulsory .. 13 Did not specify 29
These Approve:
In schools where it is voluntary In schools where it is compulsory In schools where it is not taught
96 92 82
It should be noted that this poll was taken after war broke out. Surveys figures show that since the start of hositilities abroad there has been a marked increase of approval of all matters that have to
do with national defense.

Irishmans Illusions
By Joseph Patrick Dolan With the Snnual state intercollegiate tiack and field meet scheduled for Ross Ade stadium this coming Satuiday, it’s small wonder that the Boilermaker track mob is going into piactice sessions with a determination to scare the Hoosiez's out of seven semesters of study. —I-I— Indiana, as usual, is scheduled to vin the meet easily, but in our books ve can see Puidue so close to Indiana that it seems like a mir age Indiana has seveial piognosticator’s nods to win easily, but a winnei s platfoini makes a hard plank to buck -1-1— Indiana’s spoiting wiiteis inform us that then Tollivei will run Eddie Holdeiman into oblivion this Satuiday Ya, Findland is expecting to revolt against Russia this week, too I’\e heaid that Harris is expecting to beat Webei in the shot put —I-I— Peisonally, I know that Big Jake can beat Hams, but that Hams guy gets off one lucky heave each meet. Weber was coasting along in first place at the Confeience meet last week, and all of a sudden Haiiis found 51 foot, and didn’t come near it again the rest of the afternoon. And say, Jake, quit praying for ram —I-I— I’m going to watch that 220 yard low hurdle match with interest. It will featuie an old high school dual contest between David Rankin, Purdue and Denny, Indiana Rankin went to Waisaw high school, and Denny to Kokomo Back in 1937 theie was a big Indiana high school state meet at Indianapolis The 220 lows was contested in a sea of mud, and Rankin was the loser to Denny by an eyelash Denny got the champ’s belt buckle Rankin vowed that some day he’d beat that Denny fellow, and w’hen the college year came around Davy came to the home of the cow heideis and slide lule contortionists, and Denny went to the home of doctois, lawyers, merchants, and— (I can’t spell it) —I-I— The two met this winter down at the Butler lelays, and the finish was so close that it couldn’t be decided by the judges A photo was developed and Denny declared the win nei Believe you me, Dave is out after a 220 win this week-end. —I-I— Ted Tycocki was turning some acute coiners with that turned ankle of his yesteiday, and it looks as if the broadjumper will be right among em this Saturday. For bad luck Ted takes the cake—and the crums, too. -1-1— A veiy rabid track and field follower had his dope on the track meet published in the Journal and Courier Tuesday evening, and it certainly showed plenty of thought and scribbling with the addition and subtraction pencil. —I-I— I’ve just heard that Michigan’s ace backfield man, Paul Kromer, has decided to cease his gridiron operations for the duration of his days at Michigan. Paul’s a j'unior, and it looks like another case of too much publicity for the ball carrier and nothing for the blocker. Maybe I’m wrong!

Pacific Coast Again Shows Superiority In Cinder Marks
Teller Describes 'Interior Of Earth' InPhysiaTalk
With the present track season just about over, a well-known fact has again been acknowledged in the college cinder circles. For the six major meets held throughout the country during the past few weeks, the Pacific coast has again shown itself to be the best breeding ground of the top-flight cinder performers. Coast Way Ahead A study of the six meets shows that the western lads are the proud holdeis of eight of the year’s best marks and are tied for another. The Big Ten had two top performances and held onto the other half of the above mentioned tie, while the Southeastern conference had two winning events. The Eastern games and the Big Six each held one. Face Big Ten The results of the survey i evealed that the Pacific Coast squad is headed toward another decisive victory when they invade the middle west on June 17 to face the Big Ten tiack team Five of the coast’s eight best marks weie m the mile, two mile, high jump, bioad jump, and shot put—all new records for the cir-

Ed Holderman Elected Captain Of Track Team Ed Holderman, who for the past two years has been the Boilermaker’s ace distance runner, has been elected captain of the Riveter cinder forces for next season. Ed, who was selected by his teammates last Monday night, will succeed Allen Shackleton, red-topped quarter-miler, as the leader of the Boilermaker’s rapidly-rising track aggregation. High Point Man

Outcome Of Track Meet
(Continued from page 1)
The slim distance trotter who hails from Escanaba, Michigan, was the leading point getter for the local lads in the Big Ten meet held last week-end at Northwestern. After being nosed out by Campbell Kane of Indiana in the mile run, Ed engaged in a spectacular twa in^le dual with Hoosier Wayne Tolliver.
Ed Holderman
On the last lap of the greuling affair, the Gold and Black runner managed to get the lead and break the tape with the remarkably fast time of 9:17.1, a full four tenths of a second faster than the state mark set by Don Lash in 1937. Fastest Time Previous to the conference meet, Holderman has been defeated only

once in the season’s mile competition. His 4:13 indoor mile against Wisconsin last winter was the fasti est collegiate mile of the season until Lou Zamperini of U. S. C. turned in a 4:11 effort last Saturday. In Saturday’s state meet here at Ross-Ade Stadium, the Boilermaker ace is picked to garner at least one first and possibly another. His two mile dual with Tolliver will be renewed this week-end with the Riveter ace expected to set a new state record. The mile encounter between Ed and Campbell Kane is looked upon by the sport scribes as being a toss-up between the two. Invited Coach Phillips has announced that Ed has accepted an invitation to compete in a special two-mile race at the Princeton Invitational at Princeton, N. J., on June 8. Robert M. Horn Speaks At Memorial Service Robert M. Horn, University professor of speech, will be the principal speaker at the local Memorial Day exercises. The program will begin at 11 o’clock this morning on the Main street bridge. Prof. Horn will discuss the part played by the soldiers and sailors of this community in their nation’s wars, and will pay special tribute to those who thus gave their lives for their country. Comrad Edward G. Magee of the Grand Army of the Republic of Pennsylvania, sole local survivor of the civil war, will be present at the exercises, his health permitting. Mr. Magee is ninety-seven years of age, and served during the war with the volunteer outfit, the Pennsylvania 136th regiment.

The form chart for the annual Indiana Intercollegiate Conference track and field championships to be held in the RossAde Stadium at Purdue University on Saturday afternoon, which was only obtained after protracted and eye straining crystal gazing, reveals that Indiana should successfully defend its championship with a total of 55 points compiled after a brilliant series of races and field contests that will result in establishing four new records.
More extensive probing into the future reveals that Purdue is ensconced in second place with 43 points, followed by Notre Dame with 39. Other point standings should be as follows; Butler, 17; DePauw, 6, and Ball State, 6. State records slated to go by the boards include those in the discus throw, quarter-mile dash, shot put, and two mile run. Roy Cochran, Indiana’s flier, caused the crystal ball more trouble than any other individual, but it was finally determined that the Hoosier ace will swing back into his quarter-mile stride for the state meet and drop the dashes which he essayed at Evanston last Saturday. For those track fans who must have their details, the crystal gazer went into a trance that produced the complete placings in each of the fifteen events as well as some futuristic timing and measuring. Predicted placings, times, and distances for the Big State track meet are as follows: Mile Run—Kane, Indiana, first; Holderman, Purdue, second; South-

Smaller School Of the smaller schools, Butler is given the best chance to finish first after the select three. Led by Marshall who won four events, the high and broad jumps and both dashes in the Little State Conference meet held last Saturday, the tracksters from the capital city are given the best chance to finish fourth.

Speedway Chatter
By Miliard Orerton, Jr.
Wilbur repeated. Tommy Milton, the winner in 1921 and 1923, was the only driver outside of Meyer to have taken the‘ checkered flag more than once.
Indianapolis, Ind., May 29 — Everything is in readiness for the annual Indianapolis Motor Speedway 500-mile race here tomorrow morning at 10 o’clock. A crowd of better than 150,000 people will jam this huge plant, which houses the two and one-half mile brick track. Let us get the setting of this historic track where automotive history has been written for the last 27 years. This will be the 28th renewal of the 500-mile speed classic, which has seen the speeds of the drivers mount each year to a new peak. This track was built in 1910 and the first race was run over the 2%mile brick oval at a speed of between 60 and 70 miles an hour in 1911. Each year since that time there has been a 500-mile race, which has had its dark horses, tragedies, and all of the other things that go to make an event of this kind one of the greatest sporting thrills in the world. Today this event is an international affair, with two drivers from France and one from Argentina.
Lou retired from active competition after last year’s race, having turned in 5,249 competitive miles in “500” mile racing before hanging up his goggles for good and turning his attention to coaching Rex Maysi who will drive Lou’s car in this year’s race. In quitting Lou drove one of his greatest races before he wrecked his car after a spin with the finish line but a few laps away, and after leading most of the way. Greatest Money Winner Wilbur has taken away from Meyer the honor of being the greatest money winner at the Speedway, earning $71,300 in prizes here alone.
On the west side of the track about half way down the home stretch, a grandstand starts and runs south into the south turn. In the middle of the south turn another grandstand extends east around the turn. On the northwest turn there is another grandstand which takes care of several thousand people. All the way down the home stretch, in front of the grandstand seats, .there are box seats for all of the dignitaries who gather in Indianapolis to witness the greatest speed classic in the world. -SCMany thousands of people gather in the infield to witness the race and have picnics. On the west side of the infield and the east side of the track on the home stretch side is the press pagoda where the story of the race is flashed to the world by newspapermen and radio announcers. Just to the south of the press pagoda will be found two small buildings about 150 feet in length. Both sides of these buildings are the homes of the mounts which are to do their stuff tomorrow. As we strolled down the true gasoline alley the other day, we noticed a sign on one of the driver’s doors which read, “Silence, genius at work.” -SCJust a short distance from the garages is a tent which houses the huge fire truck the Indianapolis Fire Department has planted out there, and the City Hospital ambulance. Militaryt, officers are to be found in most" any quarter of the huge plant of the speedway, and are serving as police. Local and state police officers are also to be found in most quarters. Concession stands are springing up all around the track and are expecting to-do a terrific business the day of the race. The owner; of the concession rights at the track has held this right for the last 20 years and knows about all of the whnts and desires of those who attend the annual classic. -SCMost of the drivers are very superstitious,' and watch what they wear in the way of clothing, Almost all of the drivers have built their cars from parts that have done g;ood work for them in dirt track racing, or some other form of racing that they have participa,ted in. Among the arrivals for the race in recent days was Eddie Bickenbacker, genial president of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, and Eastern Airlines, who flew in Saturday. Larry Pomeroy, the public relations big shot of General Motors in New York, was another arxiv^ who gave Joe Copps, the masterful little publicity dispenser of the race, something more to talk aboutJoe has been very busy getting all, of the news out to those who need it for their various publications, —SC— This morning at 10 o’clock to the tune of the starting bomb the drivers will be off for their annual Sffi)mile gallop of the bricks.PURDUE EXPONENT

We dropped into the sweetshop this afternoon after our initial effort at trying to raise our grade with these things called finals. The place was crowded. We fin' ally edged our way up to the bar and bought a coke. Then we went in search of a seat. There weren’t any.
We finally got pushed into a corner and we decided that there must be some reason for this sudden rush on the shop. As far as we could see things were just the same as they always have been. They weren’t giv' ing away free sandwiches, cokes still cost money and had ice in them.
In fact, more ice than usual.
Then we noticed people kept looking in books and writing in their notebooks while the waitresses hurried back and forth with trays full of stuff. Then it hit us like a bang. Finals. All those people were studying. They were also buying lots of stuff. Maybe the sweetshop management is responsible for finals.
We once read some place that the reason that Napoleon, Washington, Edison, and a number of other famous people were so successful was because they could completely relax at will anytime they wanted to. We have been practicing relaxing all semester and today we took our final in it, and it was tough. We had to sleep for three hours. In a lecture seat.

Students of a certain physics class of West Virginia University do nojb let great odds hamper them. According to the story as issued in the Daily Athenaeum, spring weather experienced lately on their campus brought on a certain wellknown disease which prevented over one half of the students from getting to their physics lecture on time. When they did arrive, they were confronted by a closed and locked door. Undaunted, the group went to work and removed the door from its hinges. After accomplishing such a feat, they were confronted by the professor, who informed them to be more quiet because they were disturbing his lecture. What price education!
He started on his crime career at the ripe, old age of 17 when he was sentenced to prison for a crime he didn’t commit. His ocfcupation since then has kept him in jail for 41 of his 82 years. Pleading guilty,* he stated, “Anything more than six months will be a life sentence.”

Dear Ed, May we approve of your editorial of Saturday morning suggesting more courses in contemporary subjects such as the course in Far pastern problems just completed under Gordon Enders? May we add that we agn^ee that Enders with his background of experience has taught his class much of what the college education is for —^how to differentiate between the essential and the non-essential? May we insist that any move to insure the stay of Gordon Enders on this campus would be a wise one and to the liking of every upperclassman eligible for the course? —W. C.
