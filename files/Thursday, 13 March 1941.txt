President Elliott Speab At 'Greek Week' Opening Over S0() Fraternity Actives, Pledges Attend Mass Meeting In Fowldr Hall Over 800 actives and pledges from 36 campus fraternities assembled in Eliza Eowler Hall last night to hear President Edward C. Elliott discuss the “Advantages and Weaknesses of Eratemities.' ’It was the occasion of the opening meeting of the new “Greek Week” for organized men. Before introducing President Elliott, Mark Keane, senior debater, presented Don Douglass, president of the Interfratemity Presidents’ Council, who gave a short talk on current and future events here at the University.
Student Prdl Shows CamfHis Still Likes Their Greek Week ' With University fraternities now mid-way in Greek Week (incognito ior Hell Week with trimmings) the Exponent has polled a representative cross-section of the student body, both organized and independent, on the question: “Do you think fraternity and sorority hell week should be atolished. The result: Only 28.5 per cent are in favot of doing away with it, 65.8 per cent like it fine, and the rest aren’t quite sure what they think. The poll was conducted along lines established by the Gallop poll and others and includes representatives of every University group. Prof. K. D. Wood ... of the school of Mechanical Engineering is in Washington this week to attend the national aeronautics meeting of the Society of Automotive Engineers. He will arrange for the co-ordination of certain phases of the University’s work in aeronautical research with that being carried on by federal government agencies. W. S. Maugham ... celebrated English author will speak to a group of 24 selected University students today. Maugham will be the guest of Professor R. A. Cordell ^^ho recgntly has finished the distinguished speaker’s biography. All Seniors All seniors should check their names in the oflSce 'of their school today. The list is for the commencement program.
R. B. Stewart, University controller and national president of Alpha Chi Rho, will speak on “The Fraternity Pledge” at the second meeting in the series tonight at 7:30 in the north ballroom of the Union. Only pledges will atterid this talk. President Elliott began his discussion by extending congratulations to the new pledges and those freshmen about to be initiated and to the fraternity leaders for “having brought the transformation of that institution formerly known as ‘Hell Week’.” “Fraternities are recognized as permanent, essential parts of the University,” he said, “and are part of a vital force of the University in contributing to the accomplishment of useful aims.” Four goals of every fraternity which he outlined are the development of character, competence, citizenship, and culture in the individual members. He stressed the existing co-operation between the University and the fraternities and said that “the University proposes to enlarge, whenever possible, the area of this co-operation.” f.i.j. Dr. Estey Will Speak At Marriage Lecture Today at 4 o’clock Professor J. A. Estey, head of the department of history, will speak on “The Economic Aspects of Marriage.” This discussion, which will take place in the lecture room of the Education Building, will include advice on •budgets, savings, and different kinds of insurance. This will be the last lecture which juniors may attend, but there will be three more lectures for seniors, including one on physiology, and two by physicians, s.s. Prof. C.B.

British May Allow Americans To Settle Food Controversy Officials Consider Vichy Importation Proposal By Edgar Ansel Mowrer Special Dispatch from Staff Correspondent. Copyright, 1941. Chicago Daily News, Inc. Washington, March 12. — The Franco-British controversy over the Vichy desire to import foodstuffs into France interests the American administration almost as much as the governments directly involved. Apparently, the British intend to put the responsibility of the final decision upon us. This means that if the Americans decide that some feeding is desirable, the British may—against'their better judgment—^relax their blockade to the extfent of allowing a few ships to pass. If, on the other hand, Washington decides that the British thesis is justified, London will challenge French Adm. Jean Darlan to convoy his food ships with French war vessels and “see what happens.” Opinion Of Threat So far as one can learn, everybody in Washington believes that at the bottom of Darlan’s threat is a German scheme to get the French fleet, or even to cause Vichy France to re-enter the war on the side of the Axis. As far as can be ascertained, the major currents of opinion among Washington officials are somewhat as follows: Virtually everyone agrees that it is proper to send milk to children and medicaments to everybody in unoccupied France, provided the distribution is made by foreigners and not by Vichy officials, who might turn it over to the Germans, 2. Some people would go further and add ^e ^rt of food speciffcally adapted to nursing mothers. Food Specification 3. Another group believes that, under foreign supervision, it would be proper to send food in limited quantities to be distributed to all the inhabitants of unoccupied France—and wish to let the French import what food they can get in their own colonies. 4. A still smaller group of Americans apparently are more afraid that French children and adults should starve than that British children and adults shodld be bombed to death and sees no connection between feeding unoccupied France and prolonging the war. 5. Finally, there are some officials in Washington (not counting the handful of pro-Germans and Pro-Fascists) who would have us feed as many people as possible in all the countries that are victims of German aggression; France, occupied and unoccupied; Belgium, Holland, the Scandinavian countries, Czechoslovakia and Poland. Scabbard And Blade Will Dance Tomorrow Tomorrow night in the north ballroom of the Union E^die Mack and his orchestra from Illinois University will play at the Scabbard and Blade Spring Formal dance. Members of Scabbard and Blade must wear their uniforms, and all others attending must come in formal attire. Invitations will be strictly by bids which are being distributed by the members. c.r.m. * Exponent Staff See bulletin board in office for Razz Edition assignments.
Queen To Lead Grand March With Chairman Jane Ostrander was chosen yesterday afternoon to reign as queen of the Junior Prom on April 19. On a basis of personality as well as beauty Jane was elected from a group- of 22 co-eds representing all campus women groups. The Queen was ^hosen by a committee of nine campus leaders, Wayne Morris, PIA president; Bob Brown, Debris editor; Peg Terstegge, AWS president; Jim Wolff, Prom committee chairman; A. B. Clarke, Union president; Rusty Layson, Student Senate president; Bob Donahue, Exponent editor, and Jim Adams, junior Student Senate officer, chosen By Elimination The group was narrowed in successive eliminations from 22 to eight to four, then to two and finally to the Queen. This method allowed the judges time to make the best decision possible. Jane Ostrander first appeared in the spotlight in her freshman year when she was chosen freshman beauty queen by Green Potters. In 1939 Jane appeared at the SDX Riveter’s Rassle as judge for the beard contest. Her latest success was her role in Playshop’s production of “Night Must Fall” in which she played the innocent country maid. Duties of the Queeh at the Prom include leading the GiSind March with the Prom chairman, posing for pictures and generally helping everyone to have a good time. Entries for the Prom decoration contest are due by 6 p. m. Monday, March 17. They may be handed in to Chuck Hansen at Terry house, 608 Waldron before that time. Any University students is eligible to enter the contest. A complimentary ticket will be given as a prize to the winning entry. t.b.n.
Favorite Melodies, Flowers Feature FloraF Musicale Capacffy Audience Sees 'Flowers In A Lifetime' Amidst softly chang;ing lights, peaceful strains of music, and favorite melodies from the voices' of the Concert Choir, the floral mu* sicale last night successfoUy bi^* l^bted the fourteenth aanusd Indiana Florists’ Conference held On the campus yesterday and continuing through today. To a capacity audience in the south ballroom of the Union, University students and faculty members, the Concert Choir, an^ gtlest artists from Indianapolis presented “Flowers in a Lifetime.” Choir Opens Show Wearing for the first time the black formals to be worn at all future performances, the women members of the Concert Choir joined the men in opening the program with “A Grace before Singing,” by Goldsworthy, and “My Hero” by Strauss. Twenty stages, indicative of the various occasions in a lifetime made more pleasant by flowers, composed the remainder of the show. Stages Of Life With the comment “Without youth the University cannot long survive,” the opening scene “The New Arrival,” was introduced by the commentator, Willard Crain, of Cincinnati. Other scenes of the pageant presented in a contiiiuous manner the progressive s^ases of life. “The Sweetheart of Yestbrday —Our Mother” was portrayed by Mrs. Glenn M. Smith and her son. Hunter. To the strains of “Stardust," tiiis year’s beauty queens, Ann Ostrander, Martha Liommel, Jean Lauer, and Jean Moses, depicted “Prom.” “God bless them, every one”^ were the words that accompanied the graduates, represented by Dorothy Kolar and Frank A.

Doc Miller, 0IUe Lynch Will Fight For Attention At Harem-$(:armn By Ollie Allanson ^ ^ We’ve seen somfe strange and marvelous happenmgs^^n these enlightened times, including an assortmeptof zoolo^^l specimens of varied hues, but never beforq^ntiFlast night did we see Doc Miller, or at least a reasonably accurate facsimile, rise through the floot. j
Male Harem
Doc Miller, as poitrayed by Don Dickson, a harem composed to a large extent of males, and even a gentleman without any pants skittering about the stage; are presented for your entertainment Saturday at 8 p. m. m the Music Hall, when the Union presents “Harem Scarem, or The Sultan Was a Lady” as a feature of the Mid-term Folks’
Day program.
Doc enters the play, which was master-minded by* Willis Wells and Bill Ha37t, at the beginning, and remains more or less noticably present until the final curtain. Another stellar performer is Ollie Lynch, portraying a college joe—^known locally as a science student. L3mch comes complete with coonskin coat, high-tide pants, and pipe; and he possesses an accurate and extensive knowledge of all sorts of things. Napoleon Without Pants You’re probably wondering about the boy without the pants. He bothers us too, but all we could find out was that he plays Napoleon. We’re not quite sure just what Napoleon has to do with Doc Miller, but he is
indisputably present except for his pants. Either Doc amputated his pants or he lost them at WatmrlooThe harem numbering about 76 also has us rather worried. of it is “him,” and the other half is “her.” The him part of it is easily explained since the sultan happens to be a sultaness. The women, however, would seem to be a nuisance. We were warned by Bill Hayt, coauthor of the play that the sultaness, played by Nancy Knotts, packs quite a waBop. We couldn’t get him to be more specific, and we before she did any walloj^gjlo we*re up in the air just as much as you about her typo of wal-
lop.
Wells, Hayt Music All music for the show was written by Wells and Hayt. Songs we especially liked are “Mattie Stomp,” “Snake River,” “Strangers in Love,” “Baby,” and “For One.” The dance routines, which we thought were defimtely all right, were designed by Marguerite Hans, Stage settings were planned by Armour Smith and Sterling McCarthy.%

Letters To The Editor
Dear Sir:
. . . trains will be m operation at the Purdue- model railroad club in the attk of the Mechanical Engineering building this Saturday afternoon. Visitors are welcome from 2 to 5 o’clock.
In an effort to justify the position that I recently took toward the petition circulated for granting exemption to juniors until after graduation, may I say that I fully support the plan. I take this stand not as an attempt to aid draft dodgers, because I am convinced that as long as our country has a heavy need for scientifically and technically trained men, and is not at the moment deficient in the number of men available for the army, juniors will be of more value to our country-by being allowed to complete their senior year. Personally, I am a member of the Naval Reserve subject to call at any time during the emergency as an ensign. Further, I am not affiliated nor in sympathy with the organizations sponsoring the petition; however, I still favor the idea behind it.
Sincerely yours, Wayne E. Musser, Pres., PIA

Well, the Phi Belts and the ATOs might behave themselves around here (?) but that’s no sign that they can’t throw a good party when they leave town. In fact they showed that they were very capable this last week-end at Indianapolis. The ATOs had their state dance at the Claypool Hotel and evidently it wds better than the Phi Belts, because they all showed up over there before the evening was up. Ann Garland showed up with Jim Glatz for a change instead of Dick Wagner which no doubt fried certain people. And speaking of being fried. Bill Mauck and Theta pledge Pat McLaughlin were seen around, too. Reckon they had lots of fun try-' ing to tear up that place. Jack Silvers was seen dragging the fire-hose from the sixth floor down to the first, and there was sand all over the place. Where they got the stuff, no one has been able to detef-mine. Oh well, such questions are better left unasked. Dottie Sieb and Ralph Nesler had a devil of a time trying to get rid of a little man who insisted upon following them around. Didn’t know that they had trouble with that kind of people down at Indianapolis, but we guess that’s universal. How’d you like that editorial in yesterday’s paper about public osculation? Now that Spring is on its way, it’s kinda hard suppressing that old feeling, isn’t it? Katie Leist’s man, Morrie Bernhard, after he read that article, was wondering why the Alpha Chi bumroom has been ignored lately in this column. That would be as bad as cutting one’s nose off to spite one’s face, wouldn’t it, Morrie? Reamer Bill Delmar surprised everyone the other day by up and getting married. He met the gal at the Ohio State football game two years ago. She’s coming down to live with him spring vacation. It sounds like a wonderful set-up. Think we’ll try it sometime.
We were reading an article in the Chicago Tribune this morning about the adventures the Germans are having in the occupation of Poland. It seems that Adolf is attempting to inculcate in the IPoles a love of German culture. But he’s not doing so well. Some day He’ll learn that people just can’t.. . Goosestep home from a beer joint.
Getting back to Colonel McCormick’s rabble-rousing rag. The only reason that we read it is because . . . Burma (of Terry and the Pirates) fascinates us.
The Axis boys unleashed all their naughty words yesterday and sent them yapping about Uncle Sam’s heels. We’ve just learned that besides being a group of despotic capitalists, we are harbouring a world dictatorship plot. Now we didn’t think Adolf would like the way we play, but we didn’t think he’d go so far as to say that we had dictatorial ambitions. We always thought we were just. . . Saving the world for Democrat.
We see that the strikes are going along the same as ever. All these strikes are capital’s fault of course. Big business has gotten labor in a hole, and now it is trying to steal labor’s birth-right. But labor is fighting desperately to retain these rights. By asking for more pay.

But returning to the strikes. They remind us of Secretary of Labor Perkins. About whom we haven’t heard for a long time. We’d like to have a job like hers. Where we wouldn’t have to do much except take long vacations. And let somebody else do all the worrying.

Indiana AAU Wrestling Tourney Attracts Five Riveter Matmen With approximately 70 entrants expected in the Indiana AAU wrestling tourney to be held Saturday, Coach Claude Reeck is preparing a squad of five men for competition in the large field. The meet will be held at 1:00 p. m. in the Indianapolis YMCA, Jiome of the defending champs. The tourney will also draw a team from Indiana University, who last Saturday finished second in the Big Ten meet at Columbus, Ohio.

Of the five men who are making the trip to Indiana’s capitol, four are freshmen and one is a sophomore. The first year men are: McDonald at 118 pounds, Mativana, 134 pounds, Gregory and Williams, 146 pounds, and Paratore at 168 pounds. Besides these five men, anyone who signs up with Coach Reeck before the deadline, may compete in
the meet.
Despite the fact that a greater part of the entrants will be high school wrestlers and unattached men, Reeck has withheld his varsity team from competition. With the National Intercollegiate meet at Bethlehem, Pa,, only a week and a half away, the probability of injuries and the benefits of a good rest will keeji the squad on the cam-

By Joseph Patrick DoUn Taking my tiaily walk through the Fieldhouse yesterday, I noticed a different face behind the desk that used to be occupied by Mai Elward. The face belonged to Guy Mackey, new administrative assistant to Mai Elward, athletic director and football boss.
—I-I—
But football is only one of Red’s many activities. It has been Mackey's assignment to assist athletes with scholastic assignments and difficulties and to keep them eligible, and if you think that isn’t a job for a diplomat, you should try it some time. Mackey has had to develop that diplomatic spirit by sheer self
control. —I-I—
Red came to Purdue in the fall of 1925 from New Albany, following Cotton Wilcox of that city, without a doubt the shiftiest back Purdue has ever known. Cotton was gaining national fame when Red entered school. Dean Skinner, then dean of the School of Agriculture, found this red-head among those listed as majoring in dairy manufacturing. Red got his diploma in ’29 after three seasons^of bull-dog grit at left end.

Riveters Strong In Shot Put, Hurdles, Relays One of the country’s most famous and colorful track events, the Butler Relays, will draw nearly 300 athletes to Indianapolis this Saturday, among them a group of Riveters 10 strong. This is the ninth running of the cinder classic, it being originated in 1933 by Herman Phillips, present Riveter mentor. At the time, he held the same position at Butler. Nearly 30 colleges and universities will send teams to the capitol city, including most of the Big Ten schools. Big Turnout
Supplementing the conference squads will be athletes representing Notre Dame, Penn State, Kansas, Missouri, Michigan Normal, Michigan State, Butler and others. Off their victory in the conference meet here last week-end, Indiana’s Hoosiers would seem to be the logical choice to secure the toga in the university division. However, two or three other teams may decide to argue the matter, especially Michigan, Ohio State and Notre Dame. Both the Irish and the Ohio squads have dropped close decisions to the Hoosiers in dual meets, the Bucks losing out by the narrowest of narrow margins, two-thirds of a point. Michigan finished second to Coach Billy Hayes’ outfit here in the recent Big Ten carnival. Ten Man Team Phillips has started eliminations to determine the personnel of his 10-man team which will make the

jaunt. Captain Ed Holderman, Dave Rankin, A1 Jentsch, Burt Anthony, Lloyd MacEachem and Jake Weber are nearly certain of making the trip, but some positions are still in doubt. The Riveters’ strength will be probably felt the most in the shot put, the hurdle events, and the mile and medley relays. Anthony, Gaulke, Wente and Bancker are expected to compose the mile relay foursome, although this is not definite. Medley Relay Either Bob Wente or Bob Jarvis will take the lead-off half mile in the medley relay, followed by Anthony in the quarter. ’The third lap, which is three-quarters of a mile will be handled by Jentsch and Holderman will take the anchor lap, one mile. Rankin will bid for points in the two hurdle races and Weber is expected to cause some trouble in the shot put, although handicapped by injury.
