The new addition will
increase
the Union facilities to twice their present size and bring its value up over the two million mark. Although they have been in use for some time the new addition to the residence wing, and those in the cafeteria and sweet shop as well as th^ bowling alleys are included in the opening. New Vocalists Union officials announced that both ballrooms will be in use as
Dorsey and the band swing out with a brand new set of vocalists and arrangements. Tickets for the dance will be priced at $1.60 and no limit will be placed on the number to be sold since the ballroom addition will be in use. Union officials extend a cordial invitation to the student body to come over the night before classes start next semester and join in the dedication of the building. Just a good old fashioned house warming.
Indiana's Highway Construction Men To Open 26fh Road School Tomorrow \ More than 1,000 men concerned v.dth the construction and maintenance of Indiana highways are expected to gather on the University campus tomorrow morning for the opening sessions of the 26th annual road school to be held through noon Friday, January 26. The school was instituted for the purpose of bringing together civic officials, contractors, materials and equipment men to exchange ideas on such problems as highway design, construction methods, maintenance operations, equipment, and traffic retquirements. So successful have been the results of the schools that state officials are now required to attend all sessions before their expense accounts will be approved by the State Board of Accounts. Road Show Opens Tuesday A subsidiary of the school itself will be the annual road show which will open Tuesday evening at 5 o’clock in the University armory. All types of the latest word in equipment and materials and many special features in the form of University and state police demonstrations will be on display at the show. Any one attending the show may, if he or she so desires, be tested for driver reaction in the machine used by the state for this purpose. Dolphin and Triton clubs, under the direction of Dick Papenguth, swimming coach, will present an acquade Wednesday evening at 8:30 in the fieldhouse pool as a special entertainment feature for the road men. Registration Tomorrow Tomorrow morning will be occupied with the business of registration in room 202 of the Civil En-
gineering building. First session, which will be a general one, is scheduled for 1:30 p.m. in room 201 with W. A. Knapp, assistant dean of engineering, presiding. At this meeting R. B. Wiley, head of the School of Civil Engineering, will welcome the road men and H. K. Spears, LaGrange county surveyor, will respond. The remainder of the session will be occupied by three speeches; one each by G. R. Harr, associate highway engineer, on highway planning; H. Atcheson, state commissioner, on responsibilities; M. G. Waggener, highway publicity director, on selling the public. Each speech will be followed by a discussion to be led by Ivan Craggs, Johnson county surveyor; W. P. Cottingham, Gary engineer; T. R. Johnson, University publicity director, respectively. Smoker Planned One of the highlights of the program is the smoker sponsored by Chi Epsilon, civil engineering honr orary sche^duled for tomorrow. Dean A. A. Potter will preside at the affair, and a talk on “Motorists On Guard” will be given by A. J. Wedeking, vice-president of Indiana Automobile Tax Payers League. The program will close with two movies, “Testing the Drinking Drivei” and “Making Your City Safe.”

'Miss Union Desk' Discusses Workings of Telephone Racket By Bob Weiss “Purdue Union. Just a moment, please.” That’s what we first heard when we dropped around to the switch-board at the west desk of the Union yesterday afternoon to have a chat with the telephone operator on duty. Miss Wilma Lawson, a pleasant lassie with a voice as smooth as silk. Slide Rule Error Conversation was neglected for several minutes while Wilma took care of the whirring of the buzzer at the switch-board. While we waited patiently to ask all the questions that we thought a switch-board operator might answer, we set our new stop-watch that Santa Claus brought us, and unsheathing our trusty slide-rule roughly calculated the number of calls handled throughout the year as 1,000,000. Finally, after many minutes, we managed to put our two cents’ worth in, in the hope of getting things started, but Wilma had to try to tell some frost-bitten invalid how to use the dark room. It occurred to us that the dark room might not be the best place to study for finals. “Wilma,” we said after this dark l oom business had been taken care
of ,“just what do you do besides connect people with each other?” Our little telephone gal replied that she did lots of things, but mostly act as a dispenser of general and specific information. Please note: She is not giving dope on final exams. Information, Please Wilma did say that calls for some rather unusual information are received. “F’rinstance,” she said, “an unknown once asked to know where to seat the hostess at the dinner table.” It seems that if any of the co-eds are in doubt about just what dress to wear where, or whether to entwine their hair with cat-tails or to tie it in a bow, the Union is the place to call. The girls on duty at the switchboard make it their .business to know about everybody and about darn near everything. They can even tell you the temperature or all about the weather. But who can’t: it’s cold. But then science isn’t as wonderful as those swith-board gals are. My they’re pretty.

Dean Of Princeton Chapel To Speak On The Great Conspiracy Against Force" “The Great Conspiracy Against Force,” will be the subject of Dr. Robert Russell Wicks, dean of the Princeton University chapel, when he speaks at the regular January religious convocation this morning at 10:30 in Fowler Hall. Although Dr. Wicks is widely known as an educator, he has gained greater
renown for his broad religious training.
. At Princeton Since 1929
Having served in his present capacity at Princeton since 1929, he has become closely associated with Princeton students and has received valuable experiences in solving problems particular to student life. His relating of a few of these experiences should make his lecture
even more interesting.
Annually many colleges and universities request Dr. Wicks to appear at their religious convocations. He has appeared at Vassar, University of North Carolina, University of Virginia, Vanderbilt University, and Ohio Wesleyan. This is his third appearance at the University. In both of his previous appearances he lectured before capacity audiences of students and facul-
ty members.
Student Associations Are Basis Using experiences and inspirations growing out of his associations with college students as a basis, he recently wrote a book entitled, “The Reason for Living.” His latest book, “One Generation and Another” was recently pleased by the Scribner Press. In addition, music will be furnished by the University choir of 180 voices and the Echo choir of 30 voices, both under the direction of Albert P. Stewart.
Dr. Robert Russell Wicks, dean of the Princeton University chapel, who will speak this morning at 10:30
o’clock in Eliza Fowler Hall.
Zouaves Drill Between Polo Games In Chicago Armory Last Saturday the Purdue order of Zouaves journeyed to Chicago to drill between polo matches at the 124th field artillery armory. This was the thir^d time the Zouaves had appeared at the armory and they were given a very warm welcome. According to the Zouave members the 124th armory is one of the largest and finest in the middle west and they greatly appreciated all the comforts which were at the disposal of the squad. Because of a few mechanical difficulties and the weather it took eight and one-half
hours to make the trip.
G. T. Dunklin . . . assistant Sales Manager of the merchandising department of Western Electric and Manufacturing Company, who received his B S E E in 1910, has been appointed to a newly created position in charge of installment financing. He will continue in his New York offices, taking part in credit and collection activities in the eastern district. Dunklin has been with the Westinghouse company since 1922.
Fun And Frivolity For Students Novelty Dances Promise Much
By Donna Seiss Our University behind the times! Horrors, no—it’s just we’re ahead of the times, but sometimes this is a disadvantage. The whole thing is that our students are conservative whether they admit it or not. We’re tsdking about shindigs, parties, dances or whatever you call them. It seems that we’re really cutting up when we throw a big Riveter’s Rassle, Forester’s Ball or some other such affair—^but, students you’re wrong! We’re not cutting up—^we’re waltzing, moseying along —racing with the turtles. If you think our affairs are whooppee smashers, just listen to some other University capers. The most popular novelty affairs at Alabama are the Sadie Hawkins parties where costumes featuring Daisy Mae, Li’l Abner, etc. are worn. It’s all very much in keeping with Leap Year, too, eds, ’cause the girls chase the boys, or is that the case anyway^ How about a real for sure-enough barn dance with fiddles, accordians, guitars, banjos, and a rickety old piano reeling out the music for the partners? By all means, don’t forget the jug. Butler University goes in for this sort of shindig and from all reports “a good time is had by all.”
Bowery Dance At Simm<ms A hep-hep ’n a jive-jive bowery dance isn’t such a flop according to Simmons seniors. The band really swings out as the dancers truck on down. To add an original touch, how about adding a jitterbug contest? Of course, we realize our students are conservatives, but heck, maybe just trying it once would start the blue blood circulating to a slight pink. Turn about is fan* play. Pet gripes, peeves, and all such stuff could be aired at a turn-about affair. Co-eds are eds and viee Tana.' We don’t mefm just that “the woman pays,” but the fellows dress as girls and gilds as fellows. Oh, what a life. Eds to suffer with all those little things, and co-eds to realize a dog’s life in collars and ties. “Gom^ as your ideal” parties are quite rei^ling. Guests are to attend the affair dressed as their ideal or the person whom they would like to be. At this sort of party, one would find football players, policemen, dopes (oops, slip of the type), big handsome high kafluttin’ cowboys, and all those secret desires. Is there nothing private these days? Stuuuu-dents! That’s right. We’re all for it.* y

By Lee Ruifner Opportunity is said to knock only once but it sure has been hammering on our door; look what we found ijn the,mail:
Badger Center Leads Conference Scoring
Skinny Gene Englund, Wisconsin’s lanky center, the fellow who didn’t do so bad with 16 points against the Riveters is surprising the Big Ten conference with his scoring ability. Guards say that he isn’t hard to keep track of, but he just slips ’em ip now and then, just enough to lead the pack of conference scorers with 51 points. A fraction of a net string behind Gene is Curly Armstrong, Port W’ayne’s gift to Indiana University with 50 points. Klein, Northwestern’s center, who is “the find” of the year, according to the Dutchman who directs the Wildcats entourage, is third with 46 points. A week ago, Englund, wasn’t listed among the first twelve scorers, but 35 points in his last two games, 19 of them against Indiana last Monday night boosted him to the top. This Armstrong lad, who drives through defenses like a tank through straw, found the bucket for 27 points against Minnesota and Wisconsin. Although Bill Hapac, the Illini captain is the best shooter per game. He missed the Orange and Blue’s first conference gan^e against Indiana, but since then he has chalked up 42 points. He counted 20 of this total against Michigan last Monday. Boilermakers Lead In Games Although Pm-due is at the head of the ladder, its ball players are not listed high up with the other laddies who make a lot of points, Donald Blanken, Boilermaker soph, is tied for 13th place with Brogan of Michigan. However, one mhst consider that the Dundee demon has taken part in only one-half of Purdue’s conference games due to a well balance squad that has men sitting on the bench just as good as those performing for the fans out on the hardwood.

Hello Purdue: What would you do if suddenly you were asked to stir up a correspondence with a girl from way down south, ^ho has the Northern ideas? That is exactly what I am asking you to do. Being a student in a girl’s school, I find the atmosphere slightly on the boring side part time, especially with some 4 dr 5 thousand girls. I am extremely anxious to start a correspondence with some of my northern neighbors, that is if it is at all possible. So if any of you haven’t any inhibitions about writing, your notes will be received with delight. This may give you a slight idea of the person to whom you are writing: not a glamour girl, hasn’t all the “oomph” in the college, is five feet, five and a half inches tall, weight 130, brunette, hobby is anything in the sports line. Again I say, write if you. willall mail will be answered. Sincerely, Box 3467 Texas State College for Women Denton, Texas
Finland Continued During the Past* Week ... to suj^rise the World, especially Russia, as .her apciies won additional military successes. But Finland continues to ask for aid of all types, especially arms and munitions,. In the United States Congress debate waged. Probably tlie little north Furope democracy will get no official financial aid f^qm this country. The Finnish Aid Committee, headed by former President Herbert Hoover, has sent a reported $600,000 to the Fipnish government.
It seems a shame to let that go by without doing something about it, so if you boys can hurriedly cure that case of writer’s cramp that comes with finals, we suggest —oh, well—all you able-bodied men are probably writing by now anyway. For the co-eds, all you lads that are true to the gal you left behind and any others still reading; this is some De Paulia humor: Someone was talking about the golfing dub who was so desperately eager to shoot a hole in par that he I’ushed home and riddled his father with a shotgun.
If you are all back again (no, we don’t know why you should have returned) we’d like to pass along a Confucius gag to finish all of them. Confucius say, “Many a rose is born to blush obscene.” —The Daily Illini.
G. A. Young’s boys, attention! “The Missouri Miner” would like to know why a girl with a streamlined figure has so much resistance. So would we.
And to top it all off the Villanovan sends a bit of good advice. If she dances with the ease and grace of a summer breeze that ripples gently, splashing wavelets on a lovely moonlight shore—snap out of it, chump, you’re dreaming not dancing! Come to think of , it we’ve heard that before, and if we have you certainly must have too—excuse us.
Small groups of volunteers from Scandinavian neighbors continue to come to Finland’s qid. Russia continues to dexnand cessation, of physical support to Finland by Norway and Sweden. From Paris, five American aviators, two of whom flew in the Spanish civil war, have headed for Finland. Royalty from Denmark and Sweden volunteered to fight for the small republic. On Helsinki . . . Russian bombers unloosed the largest aerial offensive since the outbreak of hostilities. An estimated 300 bombers participated. More than 700 homes in the town of Tammisarri were destroyed during the week’s bombings. Early in the week an air offensive was launched against the railroad, telegraph, and telephone centers of the country, apparently in an attempt to disrupt the country’s communication , system. During the raids over Helsinki, bombs damaged the evacuated residence of the United States Minister, H. F. A. Schoenfeld. The Northern Theater . .. saw little land fighting during the past week because of the terrific cold. In the Salla sector, central Finland, two Russian companies were being harrassed. from the rear by Finnish patrols. Finnish officials called the retreating Russians the best soldiers they had faced during the war. They were reported.as Ukranian troops. Unconfirmed repoi’ts say that many Soviet soldiers have been arrested on charges of sabotage in connection with the Murmansk-Leningrad railway. Russian planes dropped food, by parachute, to Soviet! troops who were without supplies from the rear. Fear Was Thrown . . . into the “low countries,” Belgium and the Netherlands, last week as reports of German concentration of troops just across the border were circulated.- Nearly one million men, of both armies, were assuming their positions for defense. Through the streets of Brussels roared lorries carrying soldiers; at recruiting stations newly called recruits reported; motorcycle police carried official dispatches. But the last of the week brought a lull in the “low country” suspense.
British Nayal Officials ... a,^mitted the loss of three submarines, Undine, Starfish, and Seahorse, assigned lo patrol off the North Seat outlets. The subs carried 110 men, but no statement was made regarding casualties. These brought the total of British naval vessels lost to 20, amounting to 79j128 tons. If all were lost on the three subs 1,876 lives have been lost. Five Persons . . . were killed and 30 injured in a series of three blasts in the Royal Gunpowder plant in North London last week. Scotland Yard officials blamed the explosions on Nazi sabotage. One building was completely destroyed. Three other attempts to wreck the plant had been attempted. Some persons blamed the blasts, on the outlawed Irish Republican army.
Opportunity for study in personnel administration is being offered to senior co-eds who-receive the two Radcliffe fellowships valued at 600 dollars apiece. Applications for these two scholarships may be made to Miss Ruth fipughton, director of the Pls/fcement Department for women. The objectives of each individual student are stressed in the administration of this course. Preparation for careers in private industry, government agencies, and educational institutions is given. Additional information may be obtained from the Women’s Placement department.

Florence Clarke Leaves Chemistry Staff Position
Miss Florence M. Clarke, graduate assistant in the chemistry department, will leave her position with the University at the beginning of the new semester. She will be married in May to John Mulder, who was a member of the chemistry department here two years ago. Mulder is now working for the Eastman Kodak company in Rochester, New York, where the couple
will live.
Seasonal recreation in the form of four pairs of skis is available in. the main office of the Women’s Gymnasium; similarly, men can obtain skis at the Fieldhouse. Also, during the remainder of the semester, the gymnasium will be open daily for mixed recreation in badminton, ping pong, and shuffleboard. The swimming pool will be closed for cleaning.
—waa—
According to Miss Helen Hazelton, head of the department of physical education for women, the gymnasium will be open Friday night, January 26, only if there is enough student interest shown to warrant it. At the mixed recreation last Friday night, a group of about 40 persons participated.
The latest discovery in novelty queenships was announced recently at Suffolk, Virginia, where a certain Emily Cross received the title of “Goober Queen.” In case you’re wondering about the significance of the honor, it seems that goober isno more than a sophisticated way of referring to the local peanut crop.
Just how successful the new marriage course is going to be is still a debatable question in the minds of most students and \ professors. According to a report from Pennsylvania State College where a similar course is offered, one overly enthusiastic student cut a test in order to attend his own wedding. Now what’s an instructor to answer to an excuse like that?

Si::? teams out of the twenty-eight
Meeting what will probably be the toughest part of their present sei^son’s Western Conference basketball endeavors, the Boilermaker net forces will open the second semester hardwood warfare against Indiana on February 10 at Bloomington. V ; The Hoosiers who are right behind the league-leading Lambertmen, have lost only one game all season, an upset to Minnesota’s fast little Gophers, and will be out to^ show the home fans that Indiana is not only the best in the Big Ten, butiis tops in the battle of the pride and joys of Hoo'sierdom. Boilermakers To Chicago The Boilermakers will journey to Chicago after the Bloomington affair to meet the Maroons who at the present time are resting in the conference cellar with a record of no wins and four losses. After the windy city battle, the Riveters will return home to face the Illini quintet on February 17i The Champaign' lads were picked by a number of forecasters to end up high in the Big Ten,, but so far they haven’t shovm many signs of being a first division ball club. Michigan Game Away After playing host to the Illini, the Gold and Black forces will hit

The winning team in a match between Lambda Chi and Beta Theta Pi will play the ATO team to determine the fourth fraternity to enter the semi-finals.
With only a few desultory games serving as warm-ups during the three-week interlude of the Big Ten schedule, the Conference’s merry scramble in the basketball ra,ce halted abruptly last Monday night, leaving our Purdue Bail'ermakers on top of the heap and a pile of statistics and facts around this^ department’s desk shoulder high.

Around the circuit, we^^find that a

crop of drapery men have broken
the road again for a. game with Michigan and a return engagement with Wisconsin. The Wolverines, who the Boilermakers will face in Ann Arbor on February 19, are tied with Indiana for second place at the present time although they aren’t rated as being of championship quality. Wisconsin, the next foe, has beaten only Chicago so far and on the basis of comparative scores will offer the Riveters little trouble. Iowa Game Here Another of the conference’s weaker teams, Iowa, will provide
out like a rash with some of the finest playing Big Ten fans have ever witnessed . . . One of the standout features of this fight iii the midwest is that of the jumping of many players into the race for individual scoring honors.

Included in this contingent of sterling players are, Curly Armstrong, Indiana, and Gene Englund, Wisconsin, who have burned up ^he buckets by slipping in 52 and 51 points, respectively, to lead the pack . . . Third from the top of the list is Dick Klein, Northwestern, who has made 46. —fc— Going on down the list, we find such outstanding standouts as MichCarlsdn, 43;/Illinois’ Hapac, 42 (This lad has competed in only three games); Wisconsin’s Schwartz, 41; and Iowa’s Siegel, 39. —^fc— We find way down in thirteenth position “Blanken, Purdue, 36” ... Step along three more positions and we find “Sprowl, Purdue, 34”; and right under him will be “Fisher, Purdue, 33” . . . Down at post 22 on. this list is “Igney, PUrdue, 24” . ; . in 34th is “Tierney, Purdue, 20.”
An unusual thing about these statistics we have in front of us is that Michigan’s Wolverines have four players. Pink, Sofiak, Rae, and Brogan, who are ahead of BZanken in this race, yet the Wolves have dropped to second place in the title scrap . .. Also there are two Northwestern men, with other teams in the conference having only one each, Chicago being the only team not leaving one player in the first 12, or in the first 17. . —f c—
The same balanced scoring that featured play during the strenuous pre-conference season has featured the Boilermaker drive to the top of the Big Ten ladder in the current title chase with four straight victories. Purdue’s successes to date have been distinctly team affairs with the activities of five players who have averaged better than five points per game more than counterbalancing the lack of any sensational individual scoring performances. Scoring Data Complete scoring on the squad f6r the first four Big Ten games follows:

Over in another pile we find some Big Ten team statistics ... In the number of field goals the Riveters are tied with their Hoosier state pardner, Indiana, both having rung up 71 . . . Michigan is in third with 68 two-pointers. fc— The Boilermakers lead again in another department, this being in “Opponent’s Field Goals” . . . The locals have allowed 50 here . ... . Northwestern’s Wildcats are in second place with 51. —fc— Again, the Purdue team tops all Big Ten opponents at the foul line with a record of 46 free throws and 26 misses . . i The Michigan outfit is second again, having collected charity revenue on 25 times in 45 chances.

Boxing Team To Be Weighed This P.M.
Away off in the distance, basket-bali-mad Boilermaker fans eaii sense (if not feel) the first warm breath of spring; and with it, an exodus from the hardwood to the baseball diamond. Schedules are still in the nebulous state at this early date, with the delicate job of satisfying the faculties of opposing institutes of learning, as well as our own faculty, still far from being completed. Southern Trip At least two things have been made definite about the pill-sockeris coming program, number one being a trip to the palm trees of Florida, and vicinity testing the mettle of Boilermaker ball players when pitted against Southern talent. Next, the Gold and Black is to play an exhibition game with the Pittsburgh Pirates, the game being scheduled for April 12. Veterans Galore When the first call for practice Comes out, at least 35 or 40 veterans from last year’s ball teams will be out, including a large number of the boys now holding top honors in the Big Ten basketball race. Infielders showing up for the ’40 season Avill probably include the following names : Doug Beaty, K. Correll, G. Hearne who is also co-cap-tain, Igney, C. Johnson, R. Keene, H. McFerren, K- Machacek, C. Rawles, J. Ridgeway, F. Smithson, W. Waterhouse, and E. Young. Boys who will be pulling down the long ones include the following: C. Caress, J. Kurtz, F. Meinke, P. Mitchell, M. Stamm, J. Tierney, J. Vernon, R. Wargo, E. Yeager, and with little Mike Bylene winding up an impressive list of wing-foots. The pitching staff, at present, is composed of Blanken, Emmert, PreiheiT, and Navta, with the receiving end being taken care of by catchers Crawford, Fisher, McDonough, and Walton.
All University boxers entered in the Lafayette American Legion Golden Gloves must report at the American Legion Home, next to the state national guard armory at Ninth and Union streets in Lafay-
ette between 1 and 6 o’clock. A corps of oflScials and physicians will weigh and examine the entries during these hours.

By Vladimir ' So far we haven’t had any last lines for our limerick lately? Too busy on finals? Or did you read the limerick, Could we suggest that “roses” rhymes with “noses” ?
At any i-ate we should be thinking of registi’ation pretty soon, so we call your attention to that course ,in education, only offered in summer school, “Curriculum Organization for Automobile Mechanics.” (Ed. 562.) Why not a course in “Cui.Ticulum Organization for Purdue Students?” WE could use one.
Anything to keep Us out of the EE school. They’re crazy over there. Have you heard about their professor w’ho swears up and down that he got a perfect picture of a baby-buggy on one of the departments cathoderay oscilloscopes ? He’s probably twirling the knobs and changing cir-
cuits now in search of a baby.
After reading what we have written so far, we are nan a iivjw wiuu uuiiuci tuau ueveiopes a Aiu mpn gaie. Nice breeze Maybe they could incorporate one of these jobs in the ventilating system for the new Union ballroom. There have'-been times when they certainly could have used one in the old ballroom. Of course they would have to strap the orchestra members in their chairs and nail the chairs to the floor, but, it might be worth it. At this point we’ll mention that of course the biggest advantage would be that you could hear “Song With The Wind.”
Nothing could be worse than that, so we’ll, refer to the radio for our sign-off line. A midget was dying. No hope at all. But he still had strength enough to rise in his bed and write in a little book. Then he tore out the paper and handed it to his friend. , “Your will?” asked the friend. “No,” answered the small man slowly, as he turned over and died, “It’s a check for a short bier.”

much taken up in fact for the average student to worry about more than the finals themselves. The one bright spot in the mantle day. Yet thoughtlessly or otherwise those in charge scheduled for that one Sunday out of six months the monthly religious convo. Now, I know for my own part, and I consider myself an average student, that I had previously dedicated Sunday morning to pure unadulterated sleep to be disturbed or broken by no one or nothing. I feel that after all, constant study for three days and the greater portions of three nights, has a just due as its reward—a reward in the form of hours of sleep on Sunday morning. But this simple straightforward philosophy of mine was interrupted by the announcement of the Sunday convo. These convos, in my opinion, are a great thing—something Purdue expressly needs--and I have attended all I possibly could; that is, up until now. "
