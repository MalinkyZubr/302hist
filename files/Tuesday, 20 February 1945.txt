We tire at slowing moving dialogue, Weai* off double features, and run for the nqkfest exit. / But “Boots and Taps” has renewed our faith in student musical productions. True, there were lags, muffled lines and timing, nyaits between curtains. But the marines 5&idn*t'attempt to ape Broadway and be flashy. They stuck to good solid music which was familiar to their audience and presented it iSyeli. With a. stroke of genius the directors added their original song. They utilized the talents of members of their own grbup-^a pianist, violinist, and marine glee club. The stage setting was simple and through the use of good stage lighting -it proved very effective. " So we see that it can be done. An enter■"^inihg musical was presented to students ^th lil^tle fuss, amazingly few rehearsals, and a minimum of slap-stick. Maybe we’re begin;ning to realize that to see a good show we , don’t need to pay a high price or hear a lot ‘of shouting.

Pearson also reported on February 9, that Stalin P* “ is expected to declare war against Japan as soon as Germany is defeated. No mention of Japan Was ' made in the big three communique, but it is significant that the call for the United Nations Conference was set for April 25, the last date on which Russia can give notice canceling its neutrality with
