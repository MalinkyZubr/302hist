Rumors
^ Rumor has reigned royally over the campus the past few days as report after report has rapidly made the rounds, distorted And exaggerated with each retelling. It Was officially repotted that four Navy men were suspected of having mild cases of poliomyelitis, fancy name for infantile paralysis. Navy men were restricted from attending any group gathering, other than classes. XMyen these few facts, rumor spread like the proverbial wild fife. Some feared for their py^i welfa,re—most griped because , they pduldn’t hav^ dates. But they all papsed the Word along. Phrases were heprd oii the campus^ii tile class room, over a coke-— “\^ble campus restricted . . .”, “School to le dismissed . “Nayy Will he restricted (lo daySj or maybe 21..“'fhiey really liave fiu yv- "‘No, it’s strychnine poisoning; V , .”, ‘Ubekroach powder got into Some aiiples i “One whole barracks and half of another are in sick bay . ..”, “It may be spinal fnehihgitis ., ", “Navy wiil be out this Week
end. . .”
Itet all of us have probably repeated or fal^at^ one or mofe of these morsels of gossip.* Why? First of all, everyone likes a good story and everyone likes for his contribution to the conversation to be the most interesting, the most'colorful, and he does everything he can to make it so. * Secondly, the students have had few facts given to them. It is natural that they should V ^k of something affecting their every-day activity and and potentially might actually be, serious. In lieu of actual information, rumors have been manufactured. Yet authorities cannot be blamed for failure to divulge faCts Which are hot known as yet. The cases have not been definitely diagnosed as polio; only the symptoms of thebeen recognized. ■ Further, little is known about how the disease is transmitted, iilthbugh it ^ believed to be passed on by personal confeaet, the Navy men were restricted as a precautionary measure. Until the cases are diagnosed and uhtil the authorities take a stand concerning the transmission of polio, if that is the disease the ‘ men have, the answers to the questions con- . eerning restrictions, vacation and dismissal

, Eirst, we had \^en- of lha opln|ion that the freshman rule has been , of ,a great help to the Big 'Fen, a^d will remain as ,a help until the end pf the war, After the conclusion of fhe conflict, or even before if possible, to fpretell the conclusion within Several months, we think the old rule should once, again be reinitiated. Also„ to go a bit farther. We think I tho three year eligibility rule should be taken into account once again, ' as also the rule as to one^yeqr residence a year before the player becomjeh eligible for play^. 'Bjie'effect of these changes back to the original ' would be to^cgrti the tondeppy of players to drift from school to school as the season changes in the case of the one-year eligibiliiiy regulation, , and. iiv the former rpjq,, tq, preyent any athletes from thtree year rule
