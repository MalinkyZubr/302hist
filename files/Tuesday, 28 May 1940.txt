GRIN AND BEAR IT
By Licthy
Purdue Is Admitted To The Big Ten At a meeting of the directors of the schools in the Western Conference last week-end several important things developed. For two days they discussed the arrangement of football schedules for the next few years. All through the conference the perennial problem of schedule difficulties caused by the refusal of certain of the Idrger universities to play Purdue, Indiana, and Iowa, continually arose. Schools such as Michigan, Ohio State, Minnesota, and Northwestern felt that they couldn’t afford to play before 25,000 or 30.000 people on a Saturday afternoon when they could play in their own stadium before crowds in the neighborhood of 80.000 or more. Hence they have avoided home and home series with schools with small stadia or small followings. This has continually caused the smaller schools to have only one home conference game. This year it was our turn to draw only one conference game, the one with Iowa. At Saturday’s meeting, Purdue, Indiana, and Iowa introduced a resolution before the conference which made the recurrence of such schedule difficulties virtually impossible. The resolution, which was passed by the faculty committee, proposes; 1. “That for those two seasons, namely 1943 and 1944, the operation of regulation IV., section lb, limiting the number of varsity football games in any one year to eight is hereby temporarily and experimentally suspended. 2. “That for those two seasons the directors and coaches be permitted to schedule nine varsity football games, at least six of which shall be with member institutions. 3. “That the directors and coaches be instructed in the making of the schedule for those seasons to assure each member institution at least two home conference games. 4. “That in one case shall any football game be scheduled for any date prior to the last Saturday in September.” This, in effect, puts Purdue and her fellow sufferers, Indiana and Iowa, back in the conference. No longer will these schools be forced to play only four or five conference games with the customary one or two home conference games. Of course, this ruling is not effective until the 1943 season, but at least it’s a step in the right direction. We Talked To'Nobe' ... Kizer to determine what results will be forthcoming from this important move. He explained that this new schedule makes it possible to have at least three and probably four home games for the years 1943 and 1944. As a matter of fact, the schedule for these years, which will be completed soon, now calls for four home games for these years. This was the sixteenth .^Vestern Conference meeting that “Nobe” has attended since” coming to Purdue and as he said yesterday “The schedule as drawn" up calls for more equality and even distribution of competition among the nine schools in the conference than at any other time since I have attended . these meetings.” We agree with our athletic director. The conference is no longer divided into two cliques. In the course of four or five years each school will have played each other at least once, It’s not a round robin because of the traditional rivalry games, but it is a fair means of determining the real champion of the Big Ten! , '

12,000 Spectators (Continued from page 1) ‘Wickum, “the gentleman parachute jumper,” next did a few unusual bits of acting in his parachute act. Spectators were mighty surprised to see him land, jump from the strappings and get to the waiting car before the parachute itself landed. The main event of the program was the ace pilot, Murphy, in his crazy flying exhibition. Along with other breath-taking maneuvers, he taxied along the field at not too slow a pace on one wheel while dragging one wing, executed several loops, and piloted the plane over the crowd in a series of sea-sickness dives. His highlight maneuver took place when he climbed out on the wing of the plane, stalled his motor, and edging his way to the nose of the

Off Wtih The Pants Other events of the airshow included a student pant race by CAA students, batwing parachute jump, and a Gliber club exhibition. The pant race, a semi-strip tease affair, consisted of a flight around the field by four pilots, a removal of drawers by the same pilots, a reencircling of the field, and a mad scramble to redress and reach the center of the field. The contestants were prorated according to speed of plane and length of course flown. The winners were Howie Littlefield, Hap Johnson, and Freddie Montague.

Gophers Make Bid For Big Ten Crown The Golden Gophers of Minnesota have crept up and emerged da a very formidable dark korse title threat in the waning days of the Big Ten baseball season. Indeed, the Norsemen are now in a threecornered tie with Illinois and Northwestern, each team ha-ving a percentage of .760. The only remaining games of the present campaign will be played this Friday and Saturday at Iowa City, the vanquished Hawkeyes entertaining the rejuvenated men of the north. Because of the existing tie, Minnesota naust take both contests to annex the title to their imposing list of conquests; otherwise the Suckers and the Wildcats will remain in a deadlock for the diadem and its honors. Anemic ^ginning This present situation was not looked for last week, before the Northwestern .Cats divided a double billing with the down-trodden and often-defeated Buckeye combination Friday. At the beginning of the conference season, Minnesota had Worse luck than any squad in the Conference in that they were rained. out consistently, day after day. As soon as the playing conditions improved, the Gophers lost their first two games because of poor conditioning. But two losses were sufficient for this contingent and they have not been defeated since. Revamped Team So revamped is this outfit that the opposition has scored only six runs in as many games. This indicates good baseball in all departments, and despite the pressure of their winning streak, the wearers of the Gold have just the impetus, to carry them to the possession of the crown. Their ability to take the close ohes is evidenced by the double header victory over Michigan, both games being taken by a one run margin. Complete Standings Team W L Pet.

A renewal of the brilliant duel for the two mile supremacy between Ed Holderman, of Purdue, and Wayne Tolliver, of Indiana, which provided the feature race of the Big Ten championships last Satur^ day, will highlight the annual Indiana Intercollegiate Conference track and field meet to be held here In the Ross-Ade Stadium on Saturday afternoon. Holderman Breaks R^ord Last Saturday, Holderman, who had previously finished second to Campbell Kane, of Indiana, in a great mile race, and Tolliver, one of the Hoosier distance aces, performed like a pair of quarter milers on the last lap of their two-mile duel. Holderman clung tenaciously to a two-foot lead as the two speedsters raced stride for stride, with the Boilermaker veteran getting the decision in the remarkably fast time of 9:17.1, which is four-tenths of a second faster than the state
record established by Don Lash, of Indiana, in 1937. An equally brilliant race is expected in the one mile run, where Holderman will team up with ‘Rosy’ Southworth, of Butler, and Curtis Hester, of Notre Dame, in an effort to snap the winning streak of Kane, who copped the Big Ten outdoor title. Holderman finished a close second to Kane in the Big Ten struggle, while Southworth had little difficulty winning Little State honors. Tough Race Anything is apt to happen in the half-mile run, where Southworth, the defending champion, who set a new Little State record last Saturday, will be hard pressed to retain his throne by Kane and Hester. Although the Holderman-Tolliver rivalry places the two-mile standard in the most precarious position, it is easily possible that new state records may be established in all
three races in view of the unusually brilliant fields.

Agricultural Engineers Study Hydrologic Tests Members of the agricultural engineering department made an inspection trip to the Throckmorton Memorial Experimental Farm, situated eight miles south of Lafayette, Monday evening, to study the hydrologic tests being conducted there by the soil conservation service and the University. The experiments were explained by Dr. Helmut Kohnke and R. B. Hickok, project officials stationed here.' Objectives of the study are: to determine, on natural watersheds the effect of land use and cultural practices and the co-existing soil conditions upon the rates and amount of surface run-off and erosion, in order to measure their value for soil and water conservation, prosperous agriculture, and flood control. To carry out these objectives 16 watersheds have been equipped with run off flumes. They have been in operation for two months.
A very erring misunderstanding has just been called to our ears by a very interested Purdue fan and employee. It seems that the column we wrote for Sunday’s Exponent gave Dutch Pehring a black eye, which we didn’t mean to convey in any matter, way, or form. As a matter of fact we meant to give Dutch a slap on the back for being a swell competitor even in the face of undesirable weather. —I-I— Yes, the last baseball game of the present season was played during a mist and continued after a heavy but short down-pour of rain. Dutch argued that the game could be continued, and he was right, because the Purdue baseball field has a drainage system that is the envy of big league park custodians. The playing field was not muddy and just the slightest bit wet; about as wet as dew-grass in the morning. —I-I— Our apologies to Mr. Fehring for our apparently misunderstood column. In our contention there is no better baseball coach in the conference than Dutch, and just because this past edition of Boilermaker baseball wasn’t colorful, I firmly believe it wasn’t Dutch’s fault. He did everything possible to mold a winning combination, but that’s somewhat up to the players themselves. —I-I— A coach can have the greatest group of athletes in the country but he can’t play for them, nor can he come through in the pinch for them. We’ve seen Dutch Fehring use the best college baseball coaching system on Purdue’s team. But as we intimated before, if a group of athletes, no matter how good they are, don’t click together, there is not much result of tireless coaching. -1-1—
By Ted Clark Byron “Bud” Fisher, who was a reserve catcher last season and this yeaFs first string backstdp, has been elected by his teammates as their captain for the 1941 campaign. Bud, a junior mechanical from West Lafayette and formerly ef Chicago, is well known to all Boilermaker baseball fans for his diamond prowess, his keen competitive spirit, and his reputation for conscientousness. He will assume the leadership duties left vacant by the retiring co-captains Wayne Heame and Fdhc Madkiewicz, both of whom will be graduated this June. The award for the most valuable .
player was given to first baseman Frank Smithson of Chicago. Smitty, as he is affectionately referred to by his mates and supporters, was the best fielding initial sacker in the league last year, but has improved his work both afield and at bat this year, his hitting average especially being much improved. Though his composite average for the season is only .306, he is the lone squad member with a better than .300 mark in Big Ten competition, the exact figure being .367. Moreover, Smitty has handled 231 fielding chances with only four errors for a conference beating .985 average. Except for the present freshmen, everyone will remember that Tom Dickinson, an outfielder and basketball flash, was the one to whom the honor went last year. Septet Via Graduation Seven men will be lost to Dutch Fehring’s Riveters through graduation. The fir^t loss is Wayne Hearne, a stellar shortstop and second baseman for three years. Acting as cocaptain this season, Wayne displayed an even better brand of brilliancy as he guarded the vital spot with ease and assurance. Perhaps one of the most serious vacancies is the one created by the departure of Felix Mackiewicz from third base. Mac’s fame as a fielder is an accepted fact, but it seems high time
Frank Smithson
We heard someone say that Bailey’s arm was over worked. If you ask us, Dutch worries more over Bailey’s arm than Bailey does himself. And no pitcher’s arm on the Purdue team was over worked. But it’s so easy to blame the coach . . . and Purdue’s coaches always take such accusations without a word. —I-I— Bob Wente, one of Purdue’s mile relay men had a narrow escape in Chicago last week-end while the Purdue track team was staying at the LaSalle hotel. Bob stepped on an elevator juat as the elevator boy pushed the ascension button and Bob was caught by the chest with the floor of the elevator as the carriage shot up.
The elevator boy saw his dangerous error in time to stop the thing just before Mr. Wente could be placed in the obituary column. And there lay Bob, upper extremities in the elevator and his feet and legs hanging down the shaft. My, what fun these college boys go in for. -I-I-David Rankin, who turned in the fastest time in the hurdles at 220 yards was royally robbed in the finals of the event. In qualifying for the 220 yard lows, Dave made a time of 23.5, much better than the 23.8 of the final’s winner, Kelly, of Michigan. —I-I— ’Til tomorrow it’s “30.” And Pehring is still a good coach.
that the campus in general realized that Felix, unintentionally, of course, has been something of a second cousin to enemy fielders all season. Time and again, he would take a vicious swing at the ball and send it into the outer gardens for what resembled a sure-fire hit, and then look only to see the sphere gathered in by a speeding outfielder. Such things must be disheartening to a player, but lilac never stopped trying and he didn’t for a moment neglect his duties at the hot-comer. Fleet Footed Johnnie Then there is Johnnie Vernon, center-fielder and a physical education student from Rochester. Like all heavy hitters, John strikes out occasionally, but when a base knock is needed, he can usually be counted upon. Incidentally, he is president of Theta Chi fraternity. Eli Yeager, of basketball fame and a native of Connersville, was used in the capacity of second string catcher, general utility man, pinch hitter, and base line coach. Stamm And Eurtz^ Too Bud Stamm and Jim Kurtz, both very capable outfielders, wiU also go via the diploma route. Both boys are P.E. students and native Hoosiers. Frank Smithson, who has already been mentioned concludes the group of seven.

Today we found a new pet peeve. The fellow that walks along whistling a tune when we are trying to make up for the week-end in our Monday morning ejght o’clock. The teacher is had enough, but this fellow IS terrible. He is always off key. * * ♦ Yesterday finals took over the campus. Everyon^ is runmng around dispensing his or her pet theory on how to get through with the least work. A lot of people seem to be banking on the weather to get them through. There is one group that holds out for warm sunny weather. They claim that if it’s nice and warm they can go out under the trees hnd study. We too go out and commune with nature when the weather is nice, but we don’t study. We go to sleep. ♦ • ♦ Then there are the people v^ho claim that if it is kind of rainy they can really hit the books. They say that they get lazy in warm weather. That sounds like us. The people that like sunny weather claim that they get sleepy in rainy weather. They say that it even makes them morbid. We don’t get morbid. We already are. Ic * 1: Personally we aie working on a system of our own which, if we get it perfected, will go a long way tow’ard simplifying the work at this time of year. It works something like this. We have found that if w-e are exempt in a course we don’t have to do so much work studying for the final. In fact we don’t do any work at all. So why not make all people who are passing courses exempt. Of course teachers might be a little hardei wath their grading, but we have a solution for that too. No grades below P.

Of course at this time of year, the old problem of cheating always comes up. Which brings to mind the Purdue honor system. It’s mostly system and not much honor. It’s effective, though. Makes us work harder designing cribs. ■x * * We see by the papers that the Allies are fighting with their backs to the wall Personally that’s the way we like to fight. Gives us something to lean on when we’re tired. Then, too, it keeps people from hitting us when we’re not looking.

Shaw, Champ Of '500,' Star In Many Sports
500-mile race in 1928, 1933, and 1936, is all through as an active competitor of the roaring road. But he has named Rex Mays, colorful “Glendale Ghost” of California, to drive his high-powered race car in the big Memorial Day classic at Indianapolis. Mays, while a fast qualifier since 1934, and at present the top qualifier for the 1940 running, has never finished the 500 miles. This year he is accorded his best chance, for Lou Meyer will pass on to the 27-year old star all his sage advice on winning the “500,” together with the fastest car on the track last year.
