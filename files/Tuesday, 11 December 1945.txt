There are those who would prefer that ehy progress in*:TOe control, Or application of the new ener^ be withheld from them. ‘Too frightenirtgif’ they say. There are those who would forget that scientific co-operation brought about, a discovery that would have coitte in due’^the anj^way. i^[^se theories may be developing into a neW type of fsbiatiOnism in which the people of the United States are well-veraed-' This new isolationism, however though it can be sanetipned by the politicians and the people, is'jas inevitably ineffectiyd'as the isolationism Americas in the pre-World War II era. S<mn^ or later an isolationist—or “let me hear no mOre about it”—-attitude toward atomic power Will he as dangerous and passe' as the political isolationism of the past. Since it has been discovered, it is the duty people as much as it is the politicians the scientists to study and to try to un.ddrstand the impUcationB of this new age. Isolation from, knowledge, there, is as dan- ' geimus as isolation from the world. ^ere it is the duty of those intelligent chough to understand to study. It becomes 1 the duty of those who;^ not understand, buL Who an® interested, to weld that interest into understanding- It becomes the responsibility of thmie with no interest to study their lack of interest or their fear, Searthing for the rcaUsttt in their attitude, Ihice fire was discovered it could not be forgotten although those of that age feared that afilmreSts wOuld be destroyed. ile With the atomic power. Though people living i» the era of its discovery fdar even the destruction of the world, J;be method of producing atomic power cannot be forgotten. Discovery necessitates control The scientists have made the discovery. It now rests "Witii the people to control The scientists and social scientists together inay4evelop a brilliant theory of control but’it must go tO the government and eventually back to the people for approval If they lack the interest to um derstand, they will Jack knowledge with which

, This cycle places the responsibility with those who are bored and afraid to avail themselves of every opportunity to leam more of what they fear. The nunierous sources of infoxnnation here at the University should Ahcoprage these bored and afraid to shoulder their responsibility of understanding,”
