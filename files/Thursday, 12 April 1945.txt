^ on April 25 at San Francisco; is taking place the most important mating of our generation. How wide awake are Purdue students to the issues involved? Opportunities are plentiful here for students to consider the conference coming up beside the Golden Gate this month. Printed material pours in on us about world organiizatioii—in newspapers, periodicals, and publications such as the reports of the “Commission to Study the Organization of Peace.” The Government 110 class spends a whole semester discussing problems of world coljlaljor^cih;, 4 ■. Wesl(?y-Hillel Forum, the U n i v e r s i t y Church, and the International Relations Club offer food for thought on international issues, If we do take advantage of these and other media for gathering information on post-War planning, and h^ve arrived at some intelligent coottclusions, what are we doing about it ? ' Are our sentiments a part of public dpinion 1—or are tljiey just private opinion? If we are voicing our ideas in some group, what is that {group doing to make itself felt? Only active ideas, planted where they will do some good are goii^ to count at San Francisco. Apd what chance do we kave Of ‘‘coUtitihg at Saft Francisco” ?

4 Backstage jockeying lias been terrific to fill Jesse Jones’s old job as Federal Loan Administrator."Controlling the purse-strings, it has become the key por sition in the post-war setup . . . For a time, Crusading Justice Rill Douglas let his name be put forward. Chief sponsor Was FDR’s one.time favorite, Tom Corepran. However, 'Douglas’ close court friends, Hugo Black and Wiley Rutledge, came to him at a dinner, urged that it was his duty to remain on the Supreme Court. Jf he left, toe. court conservatives would have a majority—especially if the Corcoran trade went through and Jimmy Ryrnes was appointed to Douglas’ place . . . So Douglas withdrew his name , . . Alabama’s Senator Bankhead at first seemed strong for Alabama’s Cliff Rurr as Federal Loan Administrator. Later the Sputhern Utilities appeared to be making hay with Bankhead. Durr is too liberal for them . : ; FDR’s first chdice for the loan job was ' incorruptible, efficient Budget Director Harold Smith, against whom the Senate could not object. The SenUte has peen fighting po many Roosevelt appointments recently that he watches the confirmation angle almpst more than any other. This; bars a lot of good men.". ■ v'V';.'; ' 4'.' ■■ (Copyright, 1946, by the Rell Syndicate,-Inc.)
