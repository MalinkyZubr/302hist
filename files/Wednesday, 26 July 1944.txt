V A xiew of a soitiewlial normal ,' SatoMay at Camp £ndicott» located ' on the ahote af Rliode Island . , * in many tdspects' life here is similar to that of a sailor on campus . . hut the discipline is stricter and inspections more rigid . .. Reveille is blown at 0530 (4:30 a. m. your time) and then our day oomjmences . . . the bugler can really hit the groOTC when he’s tooting ., V very jazzy . . . which is quite an improvement over that early tttoiming^sound usually emanating from Cary Hall about 6 a. m. . , . choW is served up at 0600 usually, but this had to be the ayem that the officers ate early—-hence it ap- ' pearhd ^ if our- hunger must wait till noon . .. however, it turned out :^at ithe man oh Watch knew somer thing was wrong two hours beforehand .‘..but as usual he proceeded
his merry way.
?pur first ihsp^ oi^urred at '8 hi im i . V aiid all of us passed (later in der tag it was another ai^ry) Vthe organization here .. i there are three platoons of some^O men each in our outfit... and everswhefe we go it is by platoc^ns . . . to class . . . to cbow • i - to small stores . . . to p^siOai training . .,. to the camp motion pilules > . . to the shore for; swimming . . . to the dentist’s office . . . everywhere we march ... we were issued two new pair jof Shoes ;. . within a umek .. > both pairs were broken in and so were ptthhy arches ... So We limped to class' and endured two hours of Jectiming ... one hour in the duties of a "Naval Officer and the other period embraced Military Hygiene ..; and were then dismissed . . . It seems that Rear Admiral Church, the--Superintending Civil Engineer of the First' Area, and Governor McGrath of Rhode Island were in camp today to be present for a review of certain battalions.^ The review occurred ^t 1031 and these boys can really march . we ate at 1100 and 1630 ... the food is fine . . . plenty of it f. cooked too . . . sometimes too crisply V . . the Only trouble is that pUee m a while the -cooks servp a di^o Pf Whbt they served at cliOO but We have cast-iron stomachs by now ; . . These cooks, haven’t yet resurrected some of those "concoctions they dreamed up at P. U. . . . the what-cha-ma-call-it salad and the liquid potatoes . . . the gravy .^ain at each meal . . . that maple syrup'? . . . Inspection repeated itself this p.m. ... our executive officer was on hand to gaze at our finery .. . a most thorough job was done . . ; several lads were nailed for shoe shines . . . yes, here we vkpejp cin polishing that leather until it's bright enough to use as a mirror whenshaving .. . then the exec went' inside . . . he walked down the lines of bunks and theh he stopped . in front of my sack . , . wmii I-b be doing guard duty for bbei solid hour this coming Sat. afteibpoh I k . because of a wrinkled towel',.. the doggone thing Wasn’t
