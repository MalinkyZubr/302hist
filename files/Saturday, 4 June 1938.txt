WSGA Counselors Will Correspond With Newcomers WSG-ff counselors will initiate their program for next year by holding summer correspondence with their charges. Names of newcomers will be sent out to the 120 counselors as soon as they arrive in the dean of women’s office. Each counselor will act as guide to four or five girls, when all the names have been received. Although the special school for counselors was held this spring, the uppersclassmen are asked to return to school as soon as freshmen arrive for the orientation period, in order to contact the prospective Purdue co-eds. Questionnaires containing information about the new students will be distributed to counselors at the first coimselor meetings to be held next fall. Other WSGA plans for freshman and transfer co-eds include a date bureau similar to last year’s, which is to be headed by Betty Jo Sexton, vice-president of WSGA. Cary Club Amounces New Hall Presidents Cary Club announces the selection of the following officers: Ralph Buechler, president west hall; Hal Lownie, president northwest hall; J. D.

Supreme Court Upholds Dr, Hass Sustaining the position of Prof. H. B. Hass, head of the chemistry department, the United State Supreme Court invalidated the broad claims of the Chaney patents relating to activated charcoal in a recent decision.

Debris Weighs 61-2 Pounds Per Copy According to scales m the Union cafeteria, each copy of the 1938 Debris weighs six and one-half pounds. Total tonnage of the 2,574 copies of the book comes to 8.365. If each of the 436 pages contained in every copy were laid end to end, they would cover 842,025 square feet. This would cover a block of land 1000 feet by 842 feet and would successfully blanket a good proportion of the University buildings.

Tickets for the dance are priced at one dollar.
Sorority Compiles Dating Figures
By Don Terrio At least one co-ed dates 10 different men, more than 60 per cent don’t have a “steady,” and most of them don’t like their dates to drink . . . these are some of the results of a secret poll taken among 41 members of a leading (and muchdated) sorority at the University of Illinois. Disclosing these feminine secrets were 9 freshmen, 15 sophomores, 8 juniors, and 9 seniors. Pin-pushing is not taken seriously by these girls; only 10 of these 41 women think a fraternity badge can take the place of an engagement ring. During their college careers the girls have amassed 23 pins from fraternity boys. Two Take Three Pins Two of them had three; one has worn two; and the remaining 15 who have been “pinned” have been content with ,pne. More than half the girls, 23, have never possessed
fraternity pins. However, this poll was taken before the annual spring pin-hanging epidemic. Three is the average number of dates per week—but two of these are on week-end nights, and half the girls never date at any other time. One of the sisters going “steady” lets her boy friend come and see her eight times a week; two don’t date at all. Dating Statistics Statistics on weekly dating frequency between these extremes are: Seven dates per week 4 Six dates per week Five dates per week Pour dates per week 8 Three dates per week ... .11 Two dates per week 7 One date per week 4 Fifteen of the sisters replied ‘yes’ to the question “going steady?” The other 26 replied “no.” Most of them date at least two men. One of them claimed she dated 10. They say that practically every co-ed smokes, but in this house only
13 of the 41 use cigarettes. Twelve Drink A dozen of them drink. Several took the trouble to specify “like a lady,” or “moderately.” Most of the smokers also imbibe. Only 13 want their dates to drink, but this number includes those who said “don’t mind” or “not too much.” No figures on woo-flinging are available, but the poll showed that 78 per cent attend shows and the dances with their dates by preference. Forty-six per cent like to play tennis, go for a bicycle ride, or engage in some other form of athletics. ■ Favorite Sport Not Dancing Members of this sorority by the convincing ratio of three to one say that their favorite sport is not dancing. Eighty-eight per cent of the girls said they intended to work for a while after completing their college curriculum. Only five of the 42 answered “no” or expressed some doubt.
Hank Miller Will Conduct Sidewalk Broadcast Today Hank Miller, question and answer man for WBAA, will again conduct his'“Question Box” program from the sidewalks of Main street, between Third and Fourth streets, today from 3:30 to 4 p. m., it was announced by Gilbert D. Williams, program director for the “Voice of Purdue.” Miller, noted for his question programs from the lounges of the Union Building, will stop townspeople as they go about their Saturday afternoon shopping. This is the second time that WBAA microphones have been at the Main street vantage point, the program last week having met with such enthusiastic response that it was scheduled to continue. Pharmacy Students Placed 100 Per Cent, School Announces All of the members of the 1938 graduating class of the school of pharmacy have jobs awaiting them after commencement June 12, it was announced by the pharmacy school. A larger percentage are going into the retail field this year than in previous years, but several will hold positions in educational institutions. Sixty per cent of the graduating students had positions before May 1; and all before June 1. Co-eds May Obtain Blanks For Next Year's NYA Ms Women students may now obtain application blanks for next fall’s NYA woj-k from the dean of women’s office, according to a statement issued by Miss Clare Coolidge, assistant dean of women, yesterday. A bill for continuance of the national NYA program for 1938-39 is pending in Congress at the present time. Debris Distribution... . . . will end with a 1-3 o’clock period today in the Debris office. There are still 68 partially paid copies and 23 completely paid copies to be called for, reports Art Siebenthal, ex-business manager of the Debris.

University Buys Old Alpha Xi House In an effort to increase the men's living facilities the University has purchased the old Alpha Xi Delta sorority house located at 781 Russell street to run it as an annex to the Cary Halls. The house will accommodate 22 men and a faculty advisor and will be furnished similarly to the residence halls. Because the residents of this annex will have to eat at Cary Hall North or Northwest, there will be a special reduction of’ rates, according to G. O. Arbuckle, residence hall manager. The sorority will build its new home south of the Alpha Chi Omega house on University street. WBAA To Broadcasf Test Programs From 1-2 A. M. During Summer Session With four one-hour programs already scheduled, WBAA, “Voice of Purdue,” will run a series of postmidnight test programs during the summer. On the air in the “wee, small hours of the night,” from 1:00 a. m. to 2:00 a. m., these programs are designed especially for students and alumni of Purdue. Featured on the program will be the news flashes of happenings on the campus that will be of interest to students and grads. The programs will also present varied entertainment by live talent. Station officials hope that many students will listen to these experimental broadcasts. Students are requested to tell any alumni friends about the programs. No one should have trouble in receiving these programs due to distance, since reports have been received by WBAA from as far away as New Zealand on similar broadcasts. Dates for the programs will be June 21, July 14, August 16, and September 13.

Jhe £diJtoh SasfA:
WSGA Counselors... . . . this summer is your chance to help build a better and more effective counselor system for 1938-39. WSGA has given you a head start by holding its training school this spring, so that lack of information will be no valid excuse for failure to perfoimi counseling duties this year. Many of you have had previous experience in this* work, and will profit by the mistakes made last season. Names of new students will be apportioned to the counselors this summer as soon as they are received in the dean of women’s office. Counselors will thus have more time than last year in which to hold a profitable correspondence. Carefully make clear to your charges just what the counseling system is and by whom it is sponsored. Explain University customs and traditions, and emphasize that you are willing to do your best to answer any questions on clothes, curriculum, housing facilities, social activities, or any other problems that may trouble those new to the University.
It is of the greatest importance to establish contact with these neophytes as soon after their arrival as possible. Remember that lost and friendless feeling which assailed even the most sophisticated of you that first night when dinner was served in the Residence Halls and you didn’t know a ^oul in Lafayette Inviting your charges out to dinner would be a splendid means of “breaking the ice” and paving the way for a lasting friendship.
That first get-together is a good opportunity to tell the newcomers of the University functions planned for their advantage, such as, the WSGA date bureau, YWCA tea, president’s tea, and the tour of the library sponsored by Alpha Lambda Delta.
Perhaps registration, that old frosh bugaboo, will prove you to be a life-saver. It is advisable here to allow the new co-ed to become acquainted with the different steps herself, since some girls are “helped” so much they are incapable of registering “on their own” the second semester.

PIA has the opinions of 4,231 of the male students about the houses at which they reside True enough, for any definmte conclusions to be made I grant that no specific questions were asked. But—we do have reasons for unusual conditions.
Politeness is, after all, merely a refined application of etiquette. Accordingly, few young people need to be reminded to rise auH offer their seats to their elders.
Students have written comments about then places of residence and we know exactly why each house IS rated low in any particular item, quite contiaiy to youi statement of May 28th
PIA lealizes that the Exponent IS working in coopcj^iation with
Alpha Phi Omega, but it would be nice if the two pi ejects could be so

New Fieldhouse Aids Expansion Of IM Activities Pew persons realize the extent of the intramural department’s sports activities when they are spread over an entire year, but when viewed as a whole, they become much more impressive. During the past school year the department has conducted 71 tournaments which were divided among fraternity, ward, short course, faculty, military, Cary Hall, and all campus contests. In these tournaments 21 sports were included, five of these being used for the first time this year. The scope of the sports activity was enlarged by the addition of the new Fieldhouse and gymnasium with increased room and facilities. Indoor track, rifle, badminton, and wrestling were the sports added because of this new building, and bowling was added to the fraternity program. The fraternity softball tournament drew the largest entry, with 35 teams and 769 individuals taking part. Touchball had the next largest entry when 33 teams and 683 persons competed.

By Joe Dolan Acting on the'stimulus of Dr. F. R. Eastwood, of the physical education department, Purdue University is about to pioneer the midwestern intioduction of soccer and rugby to college recreational activities. Rugby and soccer are the forefathers of modem football. The only places that the two games have found their way into the Middle West are around the professional recreation institutes of Chicago and other large cities. The games have been played during the past semester at Purdue as a part of the PE 2 and 4 programs, and have been found interesting to the majority of students in. those two classes. Rugby will be introduced in the advanced PE courses next fall. Lacrosse May Start Possibly within the next two years the ancient American Indian game of Lacrosse will find its way to the Purdue campus, but because of the high cost of equipment it will be introduced only after rugby and soccer have taken root. Many of the foreign students here at Purdue who have had a rugby football put in their hands during childhood just as Hoosier youngsters find themselves holding a basketball at an early age, have shown a deep interest in the sport, and have played many games up in the stadium this semester with ^ the members of the two PE classes. Rugby was brought to England by the Romans when they invaded the Biitish Isles. The English, always the loveis of sports, developed the game and from it they branched into the game of soccei. Introduced In America Both games grew in popularity and weie introduced to Rutgers and Princeton universities late in the nineteenth century. The two games spread throughout the eastern universities and soon found their way west, but seemed to find no fertility in the midwestern schools. Rugby is played with 11 men, as football, but the positions are different; there are five forwards, and three halfbacks, with two fullbacks and one goal tender. The goal tender is the only man who is allowed to use his hands. The game is fast-moving and attracts fairly large crowds. Andy
Kerr, head football coach at Colgate in the east, uses the game during spiing football practice to accustom his gridders to handling the ball, which enables them to handle a football with apparent ease. The game can be played on a college football field, the only change necessary being a modification of the goal. PE Department To Offer New Intensive Courses During Summer School New courses in physical education will be offered here during the summer school in fields of athletics, health, and recreation. The courses lasting from June 17 to July 27, offer opportunities for health teachers and physical education directors to supplement their knowledge with advanced courses in their particular fields. An intensive course on fundamental problems of the recreational movement in America will be held from June 13 to July 2, under the direction of Elmer H. Burnham, of the physical education staff, and Howard L. White, technical recreational consultant for the recreation division of WPA. Another intensive couise on administiation of physical education and competitive athletics will begin on July 5 and last until July 27. Enrollment in the first of the threeweek courses will be limited to experienced leaders in education. The University of California medical school IS planning a summer camp for diabetic childien.

Four teen-year-old Willis Dysert, a rural Georgia youth with but two years of formal schoolrng, has Emory University professors a bit bewildered They are bewildered because in a few seconds time, he can do among other things such mathematical unbehevables as finding square root of 138,799,961 and adding seven digit figures accurately—and he does not use pencil and paper. One of this wizard’s special stunts IS to ask your birthdate, then tell you your age in the number of seconds you have lived.

More smokers every day find a new brand of smoking pleasure in Chesterfield’s refreshing mildness and better taste. It’s because Chesterfields are made of mild ripe tobaccos and pure cigarette paper—finest ingredients a cigarette can have.
