The Home Ec School Where did we get our information? We got our information from the students of the Home Economics school, not only those who expressed their displeasure loudly, but also those students whd discussed the prob-^ lem quietly, wearily, with no hope of change in sight. In fact, we wrote the editorial at thq^n^ economics students, jurhior® and seniors, who felt that something shbildhe doim fbr those who will follow them. There’s no use trying to place the blame on any single student in honie economics, for the fault does not lie in the student body. Whatever exaggeration there might have been was only an exaggeration of the truth. It’s no good to say this is the usual student griping and dismiss it. We want you to clearly and impartially evaluate the present orgahization and material of the school. The principle of teaching home economics is basically sound, and any investigatiqh and recapitulation can do no harm, but oh the contrary, will serve to. strengthen the entire '■-■^school. ft* has bgen brought to our atfention by Miss Willoughby, of the clothing option, that many home economics graduates afe holdihg ‘^top jobs” in industry. That may be, Hut we would like to bring to"^Miss Willoughby’s attention the fact that those women graduated five, ten or fifteen years ago, and are IiDt representative of the present-day graduafes. It*is not the past we are worried about, for i t^ good, but it is the future that concerns us, and the prospects do npt seem as bright as they should. These editorials have not meant to be personal or emotional in their approach to the probjem. Rather we have tried to view the situation dispassionately and rationally as' would an inipartial observer. Unfbrtunately, vh# aU of^^^ have followed bur example. Ihe truth ^urts too mn^h. ’ As everyone should already kriow tjhe Exponent will be glad to print letters to thb editor containing a rebuttal or epnfirmatipn pf our ideas. In fact, we expect them, and would like to receive more than we have. However, we will refuse to accept any student letters that were assigned and read by home economics staff meml^rs in class before being sent to the Exponent. Grades mean more than truth and courage to many people, and even though the instructor would not be by adverse statements infiuenced, the students might still believe she would be. editorials, either in the past or in the . future, signed ”p.j.r.” are written by “p.j.r.”., This is the policy of the Exponent, has always been the policy of the Exponent, and will always be the policy of the Exponent.— p4.r.

Long before ^ the Leyte landings last October, •phesident /Osmena had reCei'ved reports from guerrilla leaders that his tW hoys were coUaborating
With the enemy in Luzon.
When Cerieral MacArtbur’s forces landed on f,uzon, Nicasio identified himself as tte president’s son. Nieasio was lavish in his praise for the retr^hing U. S. forces, violently denouncing the Japanese. Three days later President Osmena arrived in Manila. He ordered, among other suspects that two of his sons, Nicasio arid Sergio Jr,, he jailed. NicasiP feigned illness; and military authPritibs removed him to a private home under protective custody. His special privileges didn't last long. As soon as thp^ report reached the president, Nicasip went back to prison. He and his brother will be "tried by jury : with the rest of the accused, cpllaborationists arid punished accordingly. / n Two, bther sons of the president, however, had distinguis|ied themselves, Ur. Emilio Osmena was surgeon of the guerrilla forces ip Cebu driring enemy occupation. Captured by the Japanesei he was shot when he refused to divulge inform^om on tjie strength and ipeation of hiS guerrilla cmlcrigueS. A-ii-other son, JPse, was also murdered by the Japaribse
