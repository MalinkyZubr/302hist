Student Senate Receives 61 Petitions For Seats Sixty-one petitions of candidacy for seats in the Student Senate next semester were filed with Senate officers by the deadline yesterday afternoon. Scholastic eligibility of petitioners will be checked during summer school. Balloting, which will be open to all students, will take place at registration next fall. Seven sophomores and nine junior members of the Senate this year have been appointed to carry over next semester; the remaining seats will be filled in the registration elections. Under the recent Senate reorganization no freshmen will have seats next semester. The following is the Complete list
Parade Of Opinion By Associated Collegiate Press • War In these trying days when history is being recorded by hours rather than by decades, collegians are finding it just as difficult for them as it is for the general public to keep up with the fast pace that the nations are setting in their battle for economic and political allies. The news parade is galloping by so swiftly that the collegians by the side of the road are forming opinions on isolated events only, are seemingly making little effort to co-ordinate their views into any definite policy. With the exceptions that are always found among the vociferous and thinking youth of a freedomloving democracy, collegians seem to be forming the following platform as their stand on world events: 1. First, last and always, they do not want the U. S. to participate in any war of aggression or in any war outside the nation’s boundaries. 2. They believe that neutrality should be observed so far as men are concerned, but there is a tendency to support economic cooperation with the peace front that is opposing the totalitarian states. But they firmly maintain that this economic cooperation should be on a cash and carry basis only. 3. They believe that a European war is almost inevitable, and they think that the Allied powers of the world war have bungled in allowing Hitler and Mussolini to gain victory after victory. They have little faith in the appeasement policy. 4. The college press is vigorously campaigning for the maintenance of an open mind by all U. S. citizens, and is urging them to beware of all propaganda that is flooding the nation today. Collegians believe that the U. S. can be kept out of any war if the people are kept ac(Continued on page 2)

Missing Boy Found Working In Chicago According to a radio report report received by the, West Lafayette state police, William E. Prescott, Eng ’42, who has been missing since May 17, was found working in Chicago. There were no other details on the case. When the student disappeared from Cary Hall, he left a note for his mother in Indianapolis telling her not to worry about him. The youth was thought to have been discouraged because of low grades though this was not substantiated. Union To Exhibit Photographs From Cottegiate Digest Original prints from the 35 prize winning photographs which were printed in the May 7 salon edition of the rotogravure Collegiate Digest, which is distributed weekly with the Sunday Exponent, will be displayed starting today and continuing for the coming two weeks in the upstairs hall of the Union building. The exhibit is sponsored jointly by the Exponent and the Camera Club and was selected by the Digest from a total of 485 entries submitted from 125 colleges throughout the country. The display contains two photographs made by Robert Buckles, EE ’39, entitled “Sylvan Serenity” and “Cameo.’^ The University of Minnesota has displayed the exhibit for the past month and from Purdue it will go to the University of Wisconsin.

Winners aie selected on the basis of scholarship, personality, and pai ticipation in activities. Co-ed Honoraries
Souders, ’27 Classic Winner, Says 'Watch Bob Swanson’ “Watch Bob Swanson in his sixteen cylinder special,” stated George Souders, former Indianapolis speedway winner and resident of Lafayette, last night when questioned as to whom he thought might win the 500 mile classib.
I
Continuing, he said that they all " i""-
bore watching though, especially the six cylinder cars which were being backed by many commercial interests this year. However, his choice went to Swanson because he was young, had come up with plenty of experience from the midgets and dirt tracks, and most of all, because he was driving a car with sn^oothness and flexibility to spare, factors that count in four hours of driving at top speed. He doubts the practical aspects of super-charging on four and six cylinder cars.
Souders A Winner
Souders himself led the field home in 1927 with a Dusenberg eight, averaging 96.46 miles per hour, and the following year was still up in the money, taking third in a Miller Special. He is now employed by the Western Indiana Gravel Com-
pany.
Discussing the 33 entrants in today’s race, their relative chances, and merits of their cars, Souders launched into an explanation of the effects of superchargers, number of cylinders, fuels, manifold coolers, and inverted carburetors. According to his way of thinking, the foreign car entrants do not present a formidable threat, but that Lou Meyer and some of the old winners with their experience may be up in
the money.
Billy Devore, of St. John, Kan., wheeled around the track at 116.627 miles per hour to nose out George Robson of California as the trials closed yesterday, bringing the time of every starter above 116 miles per hour, with the average at 123.647 miles per hour.

Activities Bureau Outlines Program For Coming Year Thirty persons interested in student activities viewed films taken on the University of Iowa campus, at a general activities Bureau meeting last night in room B of the Union. These films were supplemented by shots of the local national inspection. Gymkhana, and other
campus happenings.
Following the movies, a meeting of the Activities Bureau advisory bureau was held to discuss plans of the Bureau for the coming year. Foremost in the Bureau's calendar for next fall are (1) activities round table discussions, led by representatives from the various camphs activities, and designed to get freshmen into the right activity; (2) administration of the new 3.5 ruling for students eligible for appointive or elective positions on their activity; (3) compiling the activities section of the freshman handbook; and (4) conducting fresh-
man interviews.
The Bureau’s advisory boaid will function with the Bureau’s general board in attempting to secure closer cooperation among the various organizations. Members of the advisory board as selected by their respective activities will be: W. B. Strong, Debris; Dave Brubeck, Union; Jerry Hinshaw, PIA; Martha Moorehead, musical organizations; Herb Pishburn, Senate; Ann Sickman, WSGA; and R. E. Insley, Exponent. Dramatic and debate organizations are entitled to one representative apiece, but, as yet, have
not named them.
HYA Checks... . . . for the period ending May 15 arrived yesterday morning at the cashier’s office in the Executive building. Workers may obtain their checks by calling at that office.
Book List Printed For Student Use “Recommended Reading,” a booklet published by the Purdue Engineer staff with the help of the heads of various departments may be obtained in the Library, Browsing Room, or from the offices of the heads of all the engineering schools as a help to the student in choosing good reading material. The list is especially intended as a help for those students who have only a limited amount of time for reading, and who would like to read something of literary value during the summer. Heading the list is a group of nine books suggested by W. Somerset Maugham. The remainder of the list contains fiction, drama, biography, poetry, essays, adventure stories, translations, and economics. The list contains over 100 books.

Schill Leads Editorial Staff To 293-$4.75 Business Win
By Ump Fred
After due deliberation of at least four hours, the board of umpires for the ball game at the Exponent picnic Sunday announced last night that the editorial team wins over the business aggregation by a score of 293 to $4.75.
G. A. Schilling led the winning team with 3 runs (bad hosiery) and a walk (home). Chas. Kennedy pitched ( ?). During the second inning, Rollo DeHoog, Jerry Mueller, and Bob Skallerup were lost in the tall grass between first and second bases and were not found until 7:30
in the evening.
Lutzky was hit by a foul ball in the stands. Dan Heiple also swam.
Score On Cokes
The business team’s score of $4.76 was compiled mainly by Bill Smith, Ray Hall, and Tom Mullett, who scored heavily on cokes and
ice cream bars.
Because of a lack of time, only the first half of each inning was played. The board of umpires, led by G. Carroll, was composed of aU the members of the editorial team except Bob Insley, who was (and still is) looking for the two car loads that didn’t arrive at the lake until after he had left to find them. Pi'ofessor McKee, of the English department, and Tom Johnston, University publicity director, were bewildered by the whole affair.

Take A Chance... . , . the professor isn’t looking. Pull those notes out of your pocket and read the answer to just that one question.” A small, evil voice may speak these words into almost any student’s ear as he takes a final examination. Into the other ear, however, another more sincere voice will whisper, “Don’t do it. You’re only fooling yourself; your margin of selfrespect will become zero; you will be knifing your classmates in the back. Besides other penalties, if discovered, you will be unable to obtain a University loan or receive unqualified recommendation for employment. Worst of all perhaps, your friends will blacklist you.” The best way to keep from being dishonest is to prevent any temptation to cheat from arising. The first small voice would have been stymied immediately if the student has brought along no notes, which in themselves are incriminating evidence of intent to cheat. Purdue has no “Honor System” as such, so the best way to promote honesty and checkmate those who would cheat is proctoring ... three hours of real alertness by the instructor. Teachers may differ in opinion over the worth of proctoring and honor systems for administering tests, but under present conditions, with grades at a greater premium than real learning and knowledge in some cases, the proctoring system must be utilized. Anything that lessens the opportunity for dishonest actions will result in less temptation to cheat. Good proctoring has just this effect. Instructors should tell their students just exactly what may be used during the examination, and warn them of the consequences of cheating. The really Good Teacher will have less difficulty with cheaters. Students will be loath to betray an instructor who is really interested in his students and who gains their confidence. The teacher who works hard to “get over” his material and is ready to offer each student a friendly, helping hand at any time will have few students try a cheater’s trick. Honesty At Purdue... ... is an old problem; the committee np Promotion of Honesty has struggled with it for years. Rules were codified and made more specific this year. They have been approved by the Executive Committee, but have yet to come before the entire faculty for discussion. Under the new proposals, when a student admits his guilt the case is judged by the head of the school or department concerned. Guilty cases will not appear before the committee unless extraordinary circumstances arise.

Parade Of Opinion (Continued from page 1) curately informed about all developments. This is, as accurately as can be determined, the state of the college mind today. Tomorrow’s events are certain to make it more definite— but just how it will swing no one can predict. • Lindy The return of the Lone Eagle to the U. S. and his special appointment to the army air corps staff has been greeted with little enthusiasm by the college press. The opinion on Charles Augustus Lindbergh is about evenly divided, and most reserve final judgment until more is learned about what the Colonel is doing and thinking. Daily Iowan The University of Iowa Daily Iowan cordially received him with these woids: “Now that Lindy has returned, it would be well for all of us to remember why he fied our shores. He loves his native land, or he wouldn’t have returned to take up active duty for his government. It is up to all Americans to show their appreciation of his feelings.” High importance is attached to his return by the Santa Barbara State College El Gaucha: “The chief question of the immediate actions are a comparison of his Russian and German fleet studies. When one recalls that his statement as to the strength of Germany and the weaknesses of Russia had a decided effect on English and Fiench action in the Munich crisis one wonders if he led to an American Munich. If the Russian retort to Lindbergh is accepted the picture is very black but if it is not he is still to be considered a great American hero. But regardless of which it is, the Colonel is still an important character picture in modern American history.” Daily Orange The Syracuse University Daily Orange; “One of the reasons why Germans gave Lindbergh such privileges lies partly in the use of air power as a weapon for diplomacy.
Extensive publicity given to the huge size of Germany’s air fleet has been a valuable ace in the hands of German diplomats. Fear of German planes over London and Paris has made the governments of those two nations speak cautiously. Lindbergh may have been used as means to secure publicity for Germany’s air force, and the importance of Germany’s air fleet may have been magnified by Lindbergh’s position in the public mind. However, no one knows the position he holds in international affairs, nor does anyone know what the reticent flyer actually thinks.” • Polls That college students are thinking about something else besides the current international situation is reflected in the results of polls taken on many campuses. Here are the results of a few of the most interesting: On Goldfish Gulping: Tulane University students voted 5 to 1 against the current wave of eating stunts that has swept over the nation’s campuses. On a third term for President Roosevelt: College of William and Mary undergraduates 80 per cent strong voted against the idea, although 63 per cent indicated that they believe he has been a good chief executive.
Elect IM Managers Election of the intramural managers for next year were announced yesteiday. They are: junior manager, A. E. Evers; sophomore managers, Prank Meyer, Lambda Chi Alpha, and L. Southmayd, Sigma Alpha Epsilon. Chosen as alternate sophomore managers were: Thomas Sly, Tau Kappa Epsilon, and Ralph Probert, Delta Chi.
On politics: Manhattan College seniors voted the Republican party their favorite political organization and named Thomas E. Dewey as their candidate for the presidency. On business: Gettysburg College students, by a vote of 206 to 185, believe that business should not be restricted so much by government. On favorite: Fordham University seniois paiied up Hedy Lamarr and Robeit Browning as the most popular of all men and women. On old age pensions: University of Maine students voted 4 to 1 against the Townsend plan. On dance orchestras: Iowa State Teachers College undergraduates, by a 5 to 1 majority, believe that Kay Kyser is the tops. Those polled voted overwhelmingly in favor of Hoagy Carmichael’s “Star Dust” as their favorite tune.

If a student denies his guilt, the committee will handle the case. A student convicted of dishonesty shall have the right to petition for a hearing before the Executive Committee if he feels he has been unjustly treated. Maximum penalty for dishonesty on the first offense shall be suspension from the University for a period of one semester. This penalty can be inflicted only in cases which appear before the committee. Minimum penalty for a first offense will be a D grade in the course involved. Penalty for any second offense will be permanent expulsion from the University. All students convicted of dishonesty who remain in school will be placed on disciplinary probation, terms and conditions gqverned by the committee. Outside the classroom direct plagiarism, copying another’s work without credit, will constitute student dishonesty.

NOW THAT . .. . , . finals are only a few days off, it is a custom for me to give my idea of how to study for them. —B & B— If your first final is on Tuesday, go home for the week-end. See all your pals back home and give them a good talk on how tough it will be for you when you get back. —B & B— On Monday afternoon, go to a good movie. When you get back, start a big bull-session, and try to convince others that finals are a mere nothing. —B & B— If you have a thermo final, study for your machine design exam which is five days off. Do this for about ten minutes, then remark how warm it is, and say you want to get a coke. —B &B— Walk to the village, accidentally meeting a girl you know, and buy her a coke, tod. Tell her all about the final you have the next day, and she will listen, even if she is bored. Take her home about 10 p. m. and walk to the Union. —B &B— ' There you should bowl a game, meeting a few more friends, who talk you into going to Harry’s. You stay there till closing time, then grab the next street car for town. —B & B— When you get home at 2 a. m., pick up your thermo book, flip a few pages, saying to yourself, “I know that, that, and that. I haven’t anything to worry about.” —B & B— Close the book, relax in your chair, pull out a cigaret and start thinking how nice it will be two weeks from then. —B & B— When you finally get undressed at about 3:30, you should start worrying about the test. Go to bed worrying, and have a good nightmare. It’s restful. —B & B— When you awaken that morning at 7, take your slide rule and pencil and stagger to class. —B & B— If you find a few problems kinda tough, just smile and say, “I guess I overlooked that formula yesterday.” —B & B— After handing in the paper blank, walk to the Union and remark how tough the exam was, saying once in a while, “I think I passed it!” That’s all there is to it. —B & B— IT WORKS . . . . . . too, because I am keeping up my 2.5 average. —B & B— NOTICE: What good questions could an enquiiing reporter ask students on the campus, so that the answers would be good enough to put in this column ?
“Looks like things are on the upturn, Herman! Cigars are averaging fully an inch longer than in ’38.”
A Poem What Stinks The girl about whom nothing nice can be said. Who ranks first '^on the list of my hates. Is the girl who unfailingly asks to be fed Onions on all of her dates. A mysterious, forceful compelling desire - Urges me to break dishes and plates O’er the head of the cutie whose breath is on fire With the onions she eats on her dates. As we draw near her house, I am tempted to flee. And my knees get a case of the shakes. For I know what will next be expected of me By the girl who eats onions on dates. But I kiss her and say, with my face pale as death, “We shall certainly never be mates, For I never could live with the powerful breath Of a girl who eats onions on dates.” —M. J. M.

Delta Chi Gamers 1938-39 Participation Trophy With Phi Kappa Sigma Runner-Up Delta Chi fraternity amassed 755 points to win the annual participation trophy, it was announced by the intramural department yesterday. Phi Kappa Sifema was close behind with 749, edging out Sigma Alpha Epsilon by just one point for second place. This year the first five teams in the race entered every event during the season. Delta Tau Delta and Delta Upsilon were the other two houses which were in every intramural sport and finished fourth and fifth, respectively, with impressive totals.
With five houses in all the events the title was won by the Delta Chi’s on the strength of their victories in softball, volleyball, and cross country. The Phi Kappa Sigma’s won the horseshoe tournament and were second in four events while Sigma Alpha Epsilon won a first, but captured only two seconds. None of the fraternities which Were on top last year were able to get in the first five this season as most of the top ranking houses this year came up from positions well down the list last season.

'Red’ Shackleton Will Captain Next Year's Track Team Allen Shackleton, star quartermiler, was elected to lead the track squad next spring. The team voted the honor to “Red” after the state meet Saturday. Shackleton is a junior and has been crackirig the record in his favorite event all season, and ran the distance in 48.5 seconds in the Big Ten outdoor meet a week ago. He has also been a mainstay on the mile relay team which took first place in the state meet in this event, setting a new Purdue record for the distance. “It’s a big thrill to know that my teammates have given me the honor of being their leader for next year,” was his comment on the choice. Red, whose father, Roy, was on the Boilermaker football teams of ’04 and ’05, is also a quarterback on the football team.

The big question of who will hold down berths on next year’s Boilermaker baseball contingent is of course too difficult f^o answer at this early date due to developments that may turn up during the next nine months . . . nevertheless, it was quite evident yesterday at the varsity-fijpsh ball game that some of the following men would fill Boilermaker uniforms in 1940. —^fc— Bud Fisher, sophomore catcher, will undoubtedly take care of the receiving end of the club with Eli Yeager, transplanted utility man, as a possible second . .. outstanding frosh to show their wares yesterday as able assistants to Bud and potential catchers on next year’s squad were Kearns, McDonald, Walton, and Crawford. —^fc— Fehring’s mound staff, already including Dick Wargo, Bob Bailey, Homer Warner, John Eramert, and Ferrell Ruppert, should be materially bolstered by the addition of such freshmen as Don Blanken and Fiank Freiherr, a brace of fine frosh slabmen, —^fc— Over on first base, Frank Smithson will be assisted by Yeager or Ed DanoWski . . . aspiring ’42 man competing for the job will be Cooper . . , co-captain Wayne Hearne has McFerron, Johnson, and Burroughs as frosh substitutes on^the keystone bag, while duties on the hot corner will be taken care of by co-captain Felix Mackiewicz, Correll, and freshmen Rawles and Keene. —^fc— The short stop post seems to be the hardest spot for Fehrmg to fill next year . , . Bob Igney looks like the most likely candidate to assume
Frosh Bow To Varsity, 6-3 In Year's Baseball Finale Freshmen, sophomores, and juniors met last night in the baseball season grand finale, the sophomore-junior team winning 6-3 over the yearlings. Thirty-four players participated in the game, 17 on each team. One of the late entrants into the game, Marty Stamm, cracked out two powerful home runs in his only two trips to the plate, Emil Navta, varsity hurler, also pounded a home run.
Portion Of Track Squad To Remain In Action Saturday While most of the Boilermaker track men were finishing their activities for the year in the state meet Saturday, a few of them are still scheduled to make three more performances. The first of these is the Central Intercollegiate track meet at Milwaukee Friday afternoon and evening. Due to conflicts with final exams Coach Phillips will probably only have a few entries in the meet Friday. Gutting, star hurdler, and Gaulke, half-miler, aie scheduled to make the trip with KesSler, a weight man, being the other possible Boileimakei entry. Gutting
the duties, with freshie Young at his heels . . . Fehring, for an experiment, tried John Vernon in the shoit field position for a couple of innings in yesterday’s game. —^fc— Candidates for the outfield are numerous with Vernon, Doherty, Stamm, Kurtz, and Yeager as the returning varsity men . . . Tierney, Mitchell, and Brown, frosh pasture wanderers, are capable men to step into any of the above quintet’s shoes during the 1940 season.

Blanken Pitches Don Blanken went the distance for the freshmen, allowing seven hits, but SIX errors by his teammates hampered him considerably. Vernon walked to start the game, and Hearne struck out, but Rawles fumbled Mackiewicz’s grounder and put two men on base. Fisher walked and loaded the bases, and two runs scored when Doherty singled. Wargo gave up thiee hits in the second, which, along with a sacrifice fly and an error, sent the tying runs across the plate. The frosh got only one other hit, Johnson’s single to left in the ninth. The three who hit in the second inning were Cooper, Young and Rawles. Wainei pitched three hitless innings, Navta added two more, and Bailey pitched the last inning. The other four luns were batted in on homers by Navta and Stamm.
will be one of the favoiites m the high hurdles in the meet, having run the distance in the record breaking time of 14.3 seconds in the state meet Saturday. The National Intel collegiate meet on June 17”is an invitational affair. This year Steve Gutting is sure to enter while there is a possibility that Ed Holderman, miler; C^t. Art Bodeau, half-miler; and Jake Weber, shot puttei’, will receive invitations. Boilermaker entries in this event will probably stay on the west coast to compete in the annual meeting of the stars of the Big Ten and the Pacific Coast Conference. Last year Bob Lemen and Art Bodeau represented the Gold and Black in these two events, with Lemen gamering points for the Western Conference in the huidles.
