But tty Vtette'rqh is goifig hutek tp ciyiliuu life, gets his artificial leg tyt ftyw tty medicul eprty but from- the veterans' administration. And the veterans’ administration so far has refused to pay for the best artificial limbs. Whereas, the arihy pays from $226 to $275 for willow and aluminum full legs, and from $150 tV $175 for the best quality half-legs, the veterans’ administration refuses to go above $205 for full legs, buying most of them for about $185. Hah-legs, purchased by the veterans’^administration are priced 'j^rom $110 to $125.

Result, of all this discomfort and, insecurity regarding both; the temporary qnd perrpanent legs is that the men are far fropi .their best during the difficult readjustment period when thty should be get-

Another difficulty is the. scqfcity of qrmy teebnicians trained to handle artificial limbs. The situation got so-serious last summer that the. adjutant general’s office had to send opt e special directive to serviteemen who had been artificial i,iinb
