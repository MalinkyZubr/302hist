Deans of the various colleges attending the conference will speak on the programs. Catherine Cooley, who is in charge of arrangements for the local delegation, has announced that anyone interested in making plans to attend the conference may do so by contacting her.
Robert McConnell Forgets^ But Phi Dells Remember Quoth Bob McConnell, whose pin now reposes with Janice Renick, “I did it all for true Love,” and so saying provided the means for his downfall. It seems he “forgot” that little custom of passing out the cigars, about two weeks ago, and last night at 6:15 his brother Delts raided the Sigma Chi house in the search for their “erring” brother. After ransacking the house and finally pulling Bob out from under a sofa, the two chapters united in carrying Bob down to the Brown Street Bridge, blocking traffic in the process, and “gently” throwing him into the river. Soaked with water and slightly the worse for wear, he was then taken to the Women’s Residence Hall.
Runaway Model Plane Makes Perfect Landing—7 Mile Hop
Rufina Sexton... Indiana Weather
. . . has been elected president of Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority for the coming year. She will take the place of Peggy Hamilton who resigned her position to become the WSGA advisor and student-resident at the Women’s Residence Hall during next year.

By Hank Wist An off-schedule flight was made from the Purdue airport last weekend when Robert Wickershafn, ME ’38, tried out his miniature gasoline engine powered model airplane. Adjusted to fly in circles, the plane ascended to an estimated height of 1500 feet, then took advantage of a 15 mile wind and set off in a northerly direction. It soon disappeared from sight, leaving the launching party bewailing the lack •nlor^rk Tiri+ln -haVp \JX C*. J.V.M,V4J- UV up pursuit. All was not lost, however. The runaway monoplane was recovered Saturday, three days after the launching, through a newspaper reward offer. Found by Roy King seven miles north of the airport, the
plane appeared to have made a perfect landing, only one wing being slightly impaired. The unusually high initial altitude obtained, plus the unexpected degree of efficiency reached by the gas engine, were responsible for the phenomenal flight, Wickersham said. Flight distances are usually limited by limiting the fuel supply, and no provision had been made for such a cross-country hop as resulted in this flight. The fivp pound plane has a wing spread of eight feet and the onecylinder engine spins a 16-inch propeller. Designs have been completed for the installation of radio controls by Gerrard deBay, of the radio experimental station, to guide the tiny plane on future flights.
receive Bachelor of Science degrees in Forestry, Physical Education, Science, Home Economics, Agriculture, Pharmacy, and Mechanical, Electrical, Industrial, Chemical, Public Service and Industrial Engineering. Eighty-nine of these students are sons and daughters of University graduates. No Commencement Address Following the precedent set several years ago there will be no formal commencement address. As the names of candidates are read by the heads of the schools and departments, Pres^ident Elliott will present-the diplomas. Twelve Doctor of Philosophy degrees will be presented, 41 Masters degrees, and nine professional engineering degrees. In addition to these graduates present next Simday, 89 graduates from last August, and 47 from January of this year, will receive their degrees at this time. Latta's Book On History Of Iniiana Agriculture Released By PuMishers Richly illustrated with over 200 pictures and maps, an Outline History of Indiana Agriculture by the late Professor William Carroll Latta, of the agriculture school, has just been published and is now being distributed over the state. Financed through the combined efforts of the Purdue Agricultural Alumni Association and Epsilon Sigma Phi, an honorary extension fraternity, the book, on which Professor Latta spent most of the last 10 years of his life, covers the history of farming, the development of machinery, grains, and a host of other things pertaining to Indiana. Only 1200 copies of the book were printed by the Lafayette Printing Company under the direction of a committee consisting of L. E. Hoffman, H. E. Young, and T. R. Johnston, and 800 of these were sold before publication. The rest may be purchased from L. E. Hoffman at the actual cost of $2.50 each.
Publication Schedule This is the last regular issue of the Exponent for the current school year. The first issue of the Summer Session Exponent will come out on June 16.
Thirteen Students Plan Educational Study, Trip Abroad Combining education with pleasure, 13 University students plan to spend several weeks in Europe during summer vacation, where they will study the agricultural conditions on the continent. They will work their way across the Atlantic on a cattle boat by taking care of the cattle. The boat will sail from Montreal, Quebec on June 16 docking at Manchester, England on Jime 23. After arriving at Manchester they will go to Chester, then Wales, and down through central England to London, stopping to see the British Royal Exposition at Cardiff, before going to Southampton. The following men are making the trip: K. Caldwell, Milton; H. Crane, Marion; R. Cooley, W. Lafayette; L. Gooble, W. Lafayette; G. Stewart, Greensburg; C. Kessler, Crawfordsville; all of the school of agriculture. J. Spitler, Middletown, 0.; A. Perrin, Chicago; D. Butterfield, Lookout Mountain, Tenn.; R. Anderson, J. Broberg, and H. Nevin, all of Chicago; and J. Swinney, Charlotte, N. C.; of the engineering schools, will also make the trip. Mangys, '40, Injured As Auto Hits Culvert Edward J. Mangus, EE ’40, injured early Sunday morning when his automobile hit a culvert, is now showing satisfactory improvement. Dr. L. C. Smith, his physician at the Home Hospital, said last night. Mangus was driving home from Ladoga on route 43 near Romney, when the accident occured. He suffered a broken upper jaw and an incomplete fracture of the lower jaw, in addition to severe bruises. His car was struck by a closely following automobile after it hit the culvert, and was badly wrecked. Pedalion... . . . local social sorority, announces the pledging of Ruth Renfroe, North Liberty, and Martha Whitehead, Evansville.

Jhs £dijtoA $cufA * ‘Four More Days Till Vacation’... . . . may be the exuberant theme song about eight-ninths of Purdue’s eds and co-eds will be humming this morning, but the remaining ninth will be counting instead the remaining hours before an all-important Sunday afternoon ceremony—Commencement. They’ll be counting those hours because they each one know they will be officially entitled by that nightfall to take their crack at carving a personal niche in the leathery exterior of an already much too self-sufficient world. Very few of these will wish for a long vacation starting Sunday. That enforced vacation be kept at a minimum is our sincere hope; and although optimism is not a popular attribute of most employment discussions nowadays, we may offer some few encouraging items. Indiana’s State Employment Service, cooperating with the federal bureau of labor statistics, reported a few days ago that factory employment and payrolls showed a slight gain for May for the first time in seven months. Although the total employment averaged from reports of 2,400 manufacturing and non-manufacturing establishments decreased somewhat, the payrolls of these same companies increased. One school on our campus—Pharmacy—has already recorded 100 per cent placement. Other schools have not fared so well... but at least Purdue is not alone in this difficulty. A survey of 78 universities, taken by the Northwestern Life Insurance Company, indicates tltat jobs are from 10 to 60 per cent fewer all over the country this season as compared to last—^but the jobs that are available offer approximately the same starting salaries. Those that do find jobs will have the benefit of an inside track to the better positions IF they survive the present “recession” and good times reappear. If their employment, however, does not happen to last, they have at least been able to earn more than their still-vacationing classmates. No, The Situation’s Not Rosy . . . . . . but we’re not all quite as cynical as the blank verse-smith who penned the following lines as an editorial departing sentiment for graduates: “ . . . What will you do now, seniors, You with the world before you With the bars down and the world lying there for your taking You with the pins on your vests and the pennants tacked on the walls You with the letters after your name You with the sheepskin What will you do with the world? Try out your public speaking on the closed door Sign in the window saying “No Help Wanted” Practice your French on the hamburger cook in the lunch cart Survey your railroads nobody will ever build Let economics tell you how you should spend

Dickinson College has made participation in extra-curricular activities a requirement for graduation. In a report by a special committee which established this new rule for students in this liberal arts college, the faculty assumed complete regulation of all student activities. President Fred Pierce Corson said, “The leport is the result of a long and careful study which a large number of students paiticipated. It IS based on the belief that ex-tra-curricular activities should be a part of the student’s development and should not take any time which belongs to other phases of student’s development.” The committee, it was said, has attempted to do two things; first, to restrict the over-assertive student; and secondly, to compel the inactive student to participate in outside activities. The maximum number of activities in which a student is allowed to participate is figured in terms of hours, and the minimum participation allowed a student is figured in terms of value points. The committee recommends that the student with an A average for the last semester of the preceding year should be allowed unlimited privileges, that the B student be restricted to 1,000 hours, the C student to 760 hours, and the D student to 600 hours. Also, it is required that the members of the upper three classes earn at least 100 value pointa during the year. Freshmen in the interests of their bMt orientation to college work, are excluded from extra-curricular activities beyond physical education.

To all struggling kiddies who are still taking finals and yet have the courage enough to read this scandal we dedicate today’s column — the last one of the school year. Some of the Delts still get about. Fancy seeing brothers Ruppert and Mendez at the Trianon on Saturday nite. Tsk, tsk. SPECIAL FOR THE LAST ISSUE “May I print a kiss upon your lips ?” he asked. And she nodded her sweet permission. So they went to press. And I rather guess They printed a full edition. Then there is the tragic story of the unidentified freshman whose best girl friend came through our fair city from New York, but did not even bother to call the little lad. Death, where is thy sting? Well, all things, good or bad must end. That goes for school terms too, I guess. We hope you have learned something this year. See—. 1. Colleges turn out masses and not individuals. 2. A University is a combination of a campus and a football team. 3. College professors live from hand to mouth and sell text books to avert starvation. 4. The only reason we have fees is to restrict the number of applicants—the University really does not need the money. 5. Scandal column writers take a beating any way you look at the proposition. Anyhow we’ll see you next year with lots of new dope, gossip, and maybe a new joke—only don’t count too much on it. FAMOUS LAST LINE— Summer school is the place to meet all the other people who are in just as much of a mess as you are. So remember, we’ll be seeing you.

Lemen^ Bodeau To Participate In Invitationah By Robert J. Deckard Hurdler Robert Lemen and halfmiler Arthur Bodeau, erstwhile Boilermaker cinder stars, are “getting in gear” for the final stages of the Purdue track season during the last half of June when they represent the University in several cinder meets. The timber topper, a senior student, will be drawing his curtains to a close on a one-star show that he has' produced for track and field event fans the past three years. Lemen, present Boilermaker track captain, has hurdled himself to fame with his powerful longs legs that step gingerly over low sticks consistently at 23.8 and the highs in 15 seconds flat. ^ Bodeau, next year’s track captain and half-miler, will pair with the hurdler in the remaining meets. Bodeau’s development has attracted wide attention from track fans. Last year he was only a mediocre cinderman, but this season with the aid of the new training quarters that the Fieldhouse has provided, the lad has made himself a track figure of national importance. Next Friday, the two will enter the Central Intercollegiate meet at Milwaukee, Wis. On June 25, Lemen and Bodeau will compete with a squad of track athletes at Dyche Stadium, Evanston, 111. This squad of track and field men have been chosen from the different schools of the Big Ten conference to represent the Western Conference in a meet with Pacific Coast athletes. NewSdiolarships AvailalilellextYear Several new Jessie Levering Cary scholarships have been made available for the coming school year, 1938-39, Professor H. H. Remmers, chairman of scholarship awards, announced last night. These scholarships will be open to both undergraduate and graduate students.

Further details may be obtained by addressing Professor Remmers, division of educational reference, Purdue University.
