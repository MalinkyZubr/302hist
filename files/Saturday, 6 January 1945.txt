Why?
Because theife’s more involved thEH juist Dr. Rainey’s dismissal for being liberal. .The si^ation also involves the dirty linen of a poUtical machine, a peculiar Texas hybrid of a major party. This group is rich, it is powerful, and ft wants to stay that, way. So its members are trying to iscdate Texas mentally, and tehch young Texans only the thoughts that are fit for Texans. And the politicians will decide just what thoughts are fit for Texans. Tbey hope. ^ I'k Huey Long did it in Louisiana. What’s to stop them? The people of Texas. Only they can prevent their state from becoming a^parody oif
democracy.
