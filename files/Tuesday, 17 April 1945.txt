’ It was back in the days of the Puritans, but we doubt that servicemen,, who are so: fond'of pins-ups, would really appreciate the
attitudes of the Pilgrim fathers.
And if frivolity is an undesirable characteristic in womeni, then men must be fickle, since they consistently date coeds who are frivolous rather than those who appearf to have serious thoughts. ) - Perhaps that frivolity is just a blind,ibe- " hind which hides a much-disillusioned dfoed who has been depressed in recent yearslby the ever-increasing number of campus jipes and smart guys. Why should anyone think that frivolity is confi'Hed merely to women f ' Okay, so we’re frivolous—what’s wrong •with that?' How many men want to date coeds who can tell them alt about ijumba^Qh Oaks? Darn few. If returning servicemen tliink eoeds are frivolous, it’s because they 4ate frivolous ones. And this frivolity is hot ‘ always the major part of the girls character,
but merely a gloss put on for a date.
If they are immature, then their immaturity is an outgrowth of an educational social tradition that manufactures immaturity. It’s .not just the girls, it’s the system under which
they have been educated.
The servicemen are right in saying that their experiences have sobered them, shocked them into middle-age, and it may be that the' girls they meet do not live up to their new ' .ideals, but how were the coeds to suddenly ' become matured If these same servicemen had stayed in civilian life they would have been just as immature or more so than the coeds they condemn.
