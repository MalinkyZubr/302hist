, When weete wore on and this editorial went unchallenged my estimation of the faculty hit a new low. ’fhe letter to, the editor Written by a faculty member and printed in the Exponent of January ,25 shows that part o^ faculty is still alive, however. “Ilddern universilaes don’t teaOh students tOvthink, Did; ancient ones Is i^s sue ? Can’t we be partially dn|ins)^ Shd some improvements or must we make the same errors that our parents made? Must

What is the evidence?” It seejns tp n?ie tbat, tbe acute problem of cheating and the, very attitude of the student toward school and learnV upppjst the ac^usati^,: An acldpd readii^ assignment or some extra problems is given as punishment for misbeha^^^ js (ipnp, in universitieg, :high schools, an,^, spools, A test is not an evaluation of knowi-

“Eoes a student pay his tuition tp be ,educated; or to educate thp faculty?” Many people wonder just why students pay their tuitions and insist on bein;g short changed by leaniing less than a maximum. This is not in ^epjttg ^ other busiriess transactions. I agree with you, faculty member, in many insipnpcs ypu arc pveri'wortasdj but even with your;mo8tWaliant efforts expended many students dp not receive sufficient instruction. I also feel that compensation for such vital services is entirely inadequate; this condition sj^uld be rectified, What can we do as students to bring about desired dhanges? ¥ery little through the sdlr^i for all pTo^s^^ are not open to criticism, and to be trite “Grades are gradeP”.
