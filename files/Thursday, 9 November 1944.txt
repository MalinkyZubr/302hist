TexAs h Ndt Alone ... In recent weeks the state nf Texas has bedn witnessing a titantic fight fdr acsad^mic freedom conducted mostly by tiie studeht body of the University of Texas. Spearheading the attack against reactionary regents is the student daily paper. The Daily Texas! . .As late as I93t the Texan was fighting to preserve the right of freedom of the press, fighting against the same Fascism that’s tryi ing to stamp out opposition now. They won that fight. ■ . With a iittle help, they will win this one, and education in Texas will come out of the Dark Ages. w.. But the students of the University of Texas do need help in their fight against political, arbitrary supervision of their university:, and they’re going to |:et it. The Texas alumni are backing them, their families are backing them, and the facultiy is backing them, but isfth^s enough? is the question of academic freedom impdrtant only to those who are fighting for it
