The Best Teacher Award and Leather Med--vlal rMlLh awarded by Sigma Delta Chi, national journalism fraternity, sometime in the
middle of the semester.
However, this time the procedure for selecting the person to be honored has been ■varied.' SDX has decided to give the students more opportunity 'to show their opinion, of who is realise the best teacher.' In the p^Si' SDX has always given a banquet to which they invited the leaders of all activities who in turn indicated their preferences. iJow SDX proposes to consult representative members of each school on campus and also invites the student body in general to 'give' their choice by sending letters to, the Exponent office giving the reason why they consider their candidates good teachers,. “■ In the past SDX has chosen'those to be honored as honestly and as impartially as possible, but they have fell that the sampling of opinions was not universal enough. And so it’s now up to you, the students, to 3 :ina^e the sampling fair. - If you have had an instructor, or have one at the present time whosetteaching you consid^ above average, or perhaps even but of thife world, then write a letter to the SDX in g; ^re^ctf the Exponent office and name your
favorite instructor.
Bfemember, SDX wants to know why , you consider this instructor a good teacher, perhag^' state specific instances,, and in eyery way qualify your suggestion. Don!t forget the box top.—p.j.r.
