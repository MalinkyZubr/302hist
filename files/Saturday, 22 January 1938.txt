^Big Apple, ’ Temple, Earhart Win Most Quiz Recognition
By Joyce Williams
“Electrons, X Particles,, and Neutrons” will be the subject of an address by Dr. H. R. Crane, of the University of Michigan physics department, when he speaks before members of the University department of physics, January 29. Formerly with the Kellogg Radiation Laboratories, Pasadena, California, Dr. Crane is responsible for important researches “in the field of determining the new particles, their mass and their properties, and has been closely associated ■Odth recent researches in the matter of the much debated X Particle.
“Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs”—^“Play which burlesques the activities of the U. S. Supreme Court,” wrote one student in Prof. 0. F. Hall’s leadership course. Education 50, on the recent annual test of recognition of names in the news during the past year. While last year only Shirley, Temple received the accolade of a unanimous vote, this honor was shared this year with, Amelia Earhart and the Big Apple. The lack of oAe vote prevented Joe Louis, Myrna Loy, and “The Coronation” from gaining equal distinction. Unknown to all were George D. Aiken, Vermont governor, and Albert Szent-Gyoerg-yi, Nobel Prize winner in medicine.
Weird Guesses
Dr. H. R. Kraybill Talks At Hammond C of C Lunch Speaking on “Utilization of Agricultural Products in Industry,” Dr. H. R. Kraybill, head of the Purdue agricultural chemistry department, addressed thp Hammond Chamber of Commerce at its regular luncheon meeting Thursday.
Vying for the title of weirdest guess were the student who loosed the bouble-edged barb, “Howard Hughes—aged member of S,hpreme Court” and his opponent who countered by urbanely labelling A. A. Jardine, clergyman who officiated, at the Wallis-Windsor nuptials, as a famous oleomargarine magnate. That students are not completely familiar with foreign news is evident in the transposition of the personalities of Emperor Hirohito and Generalissimo Chiang Kai-Shek and the usurpation of War Admiral’s name to christen a “sWp 8ept by Japan to the United States.” The
same fraility is responsibility for Glenn Frank’s being named Leftist leader of Spain. Charlie McCarthy flattered Edgar Bergen’s ventriloquistic powers by
being called “sports announcer, machine gun style,” and “mental ability by being named “manager of the New York Giants.” Last year five classes averaged
only 34 correct answers, which makes this year’s average of 43 seem somewhat startling. Since the test was administered to only two classes, the latter number is com-
parable to that of two years ago, which was but one point higher and was achieved under similar conditions. Top score, 74, was made by C. G. Elliott, junior Ag.

Is Your Mind...
blank^^ievoid of study material, when you begin to write a final ? This subsequent suggestion is not a new cure-all but only a helpful hint. ““Perhaps you have been eating heavy foods, which cause your blood to leave the brain to aid in digestion. Such difficult-to-digest foods (note—not indigestible) are fried foods, cake and pastry. Since you want the blood to be closer to the brain than to the stomach, simply prepared foods should be favored during finals. Food in the natural state is especially helpful to students who are under strong mental strain. Citrous fruits, milk and dairy products, vegetables .and eggs are more quickly absorbed by the^body than are rich mixtures. The fastest rate of absorption, the food that brings energy to the body the soonest, is plain sugar. If sugar is not available, candy can be substituted. The rate of absorption of fat by body processes is slower than the rate of absorption for sugar. Milk is especially helpful to students during finals. A practical example of this is found in the Women’s Residence Halls. At 9:30 every night during finals milk and crackers are served in the recreation room to girls who desire the refreshmeift. This food suggestion, if it is carried out, need not wreck the usual menu. By choosing dairy products, vegetables, fruits or sugar at lunch before an important final, your brain is clearer to remember formulas, dates, processes, and principles, which are demanding your closest attention and clearest thinking at one o’clock. Breakfast need not be disturbed a great deal for toast, milk or coifee, cereal, and fruit, is a common, healthy menu. However if you are fond of pancakes, sausage, or even bacon, you should postpone these delicacies to a morning when less brain work is expected. —E. C. P.

Letters to the Editor
Make Book Exchange Permanent Fixture
Deal' Editor: It is very interesting to see in the issue of January 19th the story on the theft of the Student Book Exchange placards. Whether these posters were stolen by pranksters or by men wishing to hamper the Book Exchange is of no consequence, but it does bring to mind a very pertinent point—that the Student Book Exchange will be a severe blow to the local bookstores.
Certainly if the idea of this year’s Book Exchange is carried on, it will grow to major proportions and may finally result in the elimination of the village book-merchants. It is a moot question as to whether or not this is to be desired, but I, for one, am greatly in favor of seeing this newly founded movement become a permanent feature on the campus. A method of saving money on the books has long been sought, and the Student Book Exchange is a logical and excellent starting point. However, inasmuch as books are an important part of the University,
it should be the University’s responsibility, rather than that of the students to see that an exchange of this nature is continued. With University support and control, this Book Exchange might eventually become a University Bookstore, an organization of which any school would be proud. W. E. Dunshee, ME ’40.
By Mary Cooley Organized “gripe sessions” by Kansas State College students provide dissatisfied students with the time and place to pan their faculty and air their grievances. Thq chief current complaint is wide-felt opposition to compulsory military training for all men students. One of the session speakers proposed the students petition the state legislature to repeal the law requiring all male students to study military science. Other complaints voiced dissatisfaction with college rules requiring students to attend assembly and forbidding smoking on the campus.
Butler University has extended the educational opportunities in the establishment of a college of business administration and a junior college during the past year.

“Aw, let’s chuck it all and take in a good movie.”
The new business administration college was created to provide “practical training for future business men and women.” Since it is located in the capital of the state, Butler University is able to use the city as a laboratory for the new school. The new junior college, which provides a two-year course for students with insufficient funds to complete a regular course of four years of study, enables them to specialize in their major subject during the freshman and sophomore years. After finishing this course, the student receives an associate in science or an associate in arts degree.

though they do not see action. Northwestern, resting at the top of the heap due to four victories fn five conference engagements, meets the Michigan Wolverines on the Northwestern "floor this evening. Michigan now stands tied with the Riveters in second place, with three
wins and one defeat.
The two tesims which will vie for the top position tonight have the best defensive records in the conference to date. Michigan’s opponenlA have scored 120 points in four games for a 30-point average, while the Wildcat foes have averaged 33.2 tallies per tilt. Each team suffered its first Big Ten setback on Monday night when the Badgers, spiked by the Gold and Black defeat, trounced Michigan 39-30, and the Boilermakers took the measure of the Wildcats 37-26. Buckeyes and Illin^ Illinois and Ohio State, both in the lower bracket of the conference at present, tangle at Columbus, 0. The main feature of this tussle will be the individual action between the Buckeye captain Jim MacDonald, outstanding defensive man, and Pick Dehner, lllini scoring ace and lanky pivot man.
Dehner has netted 90 points in five games thus far this season, putting him 32 points ahead of Jewell Young in the Big Ten scoring race. Illinois has won two conference contests out of five while the Buckeyes have won one out of three.
Overheard at Princeton— “He’s a fraternity man.” “How do you know?” “He answered to four names in class this.morning.”
A new beau fvery day is advocated for girls in their ’teens by Dr. Walter B. Townsend, Butler University professor. We have-nt last found a good use for those army uniforms that we are forced to accept as part of college life. They are very good for navigating the snow drifts as they can’t be damaged.
Faculty Swimming pool will be open for the faculty each evening until 6 o’clock.

Ccfgers Tops In New Rating By R. Jenkins If the Big Ten teams were rated by their margin' of victory Piggy Lambert’s cagers would be at the top of the stack. By taking the difference in total points scored by each conference team and its opponents, and dividing by the number of games played, we have a margin of 25 points for the Riveters in four contests which makes a 6.25 average margin. Michigan, in the same number of games, has an average of 6.00. Third in line is Wisconsin, the team that upset the Wolverines Monday, with a 4.8 margin in five tilts. Ohio State would look more impressive under such a rating system with a 2.67 average in only three games. Then would come the leading Wildcats with only a 2.00 margin in five engagements. Illinois and her opponents are squared off with 214 tapies each, so the lllini rating would be 0.00. Teams “in the red” would include Indiana with a -2.00 average, Minnesota with -2.75, Iowa with -3.75, and Chicago with -6.33.
Faculty Members Gym class meet 4:30 to 5:30 p. m. Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Courts in the Faculty Gym are closed until 4 p. m. because of the examinations on the third floor of-the-Recitation Building until January 28.
Squash Equipment Available Any Time Those squash enthusiasts who want to brush up on their game during finals will have plenty of opportunity according to" “Chief” Clevett. ^Equipment is being placed at the disposal of the students mainly for the benefit of those freshmen who plan to ^ry out for the squash team, and also for those fraternity men wih will be entering the inter-fra-ternity meets in the sport next semester. Rackets and balls may be obtained at the check-out room in the gymnasium, and the students can play on the faculty com-ts on the fourth floor of the Recitation Building from 1 to 3 o’clock in the afternoon or may use the town courts from 1 to 10 p. m. These courts are located at the Corner of Eighth and Main Streets in Lafayette.
