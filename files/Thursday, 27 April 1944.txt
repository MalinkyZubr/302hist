Roger Lapham, head of the AmeXican-Ha-waiian Steamship Cohipahy, and Gem*ge Mdad, head of the Mead Corporation, paper company of Dayton, Ohio, were especially cooperative. But now Lapham has^left to be mayor of Sap, Francisco, while Mead has been Virtually 'shunted off the board as a result of wire-pulling from the U. S.

Fred Crawford, former president of the, Manufacturers Association, whose Thompson Products, Inc., of Cleveland has a reactionary labor record, has now organized a joint committee of the NAM and U. S.
