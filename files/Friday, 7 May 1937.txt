Ross Dean hit a home run with the bases loaded to allow the Boilermaker • to defeat the Little Giant nine from Wabash, 5 to 0, last night on Intramhral Field. The Boilermaker pitchers, Downey and Heiss, held the Wabash squad tp three hits and fanned 11 of the Little Giant hitters in the third game of the year between Purdue and Wabash. Dean’s blow came in the sixth after two were out and the bases loaded. Baker fanned to start the inning. Breslin singled and went to third on Prestin’s two-base error on Malysiak’s fly to right field. Waling was given an intentional pass to fill the bases. Dean replaced Lucas in the Purdue batting order and hit a four-bagger to clean up the bases . Glen Downey started the game and gave up only two hits during the five innings that he pitched. Downey struck out six, walked one, and hit one batter. Stu Heiss relieved Downey and held Wabash hitless until two were out in the ninth when Hanscom, Little Giant first sacker, spoiled the Boilermaker hurler’s record with a single. The local squad was never in any serious trouble during the contest as only two Wabash runners got as far as second base and both were left stranded on the keystone sack. Breslin turned in a good day at the plate, scoring two runs on two hits in four trips to the plate. On his first trip up Breslin tripled to start the inning and Malysiak then walked to put a man on first and a man on third. Waling and Lucas popped up and, when the Purdue hopes darkened, the two runners pulled a double steal to score Breslin.

exhibit works of mary coulter in union music room By Tom Garland An extraordinary versatility, with no concessions to mediocrity in any of the mediums in which she works is the outstanding characteristic of the artistic talent of Mary J. Coulter, world-famous artist and etcher, an exhibition of whose work is now hung in the music room of the Memorial Union Building. She evidences an amazing skill, thorough understanding of the medium, and a richly gifted imagination tempered with a true sense of artistic values. Her exhibition, which includes 40 wood-blocks, dry-points, and etchings, has three prints of particular interest to the art lover. “Earthbound,” a line etching which has received much favorable criticism in this country and abroad, is the reproduction of a tree representing the soul of a woman in torment. “Crucifixion,” another line etching, was printed by Mrs. Coulter from an old copper plate, artist unknown, dated 1746, which she discovered in the course of her travels. Probably her most famous piece of work is “The House By The Road,” a drypoint, a duplicate copy of which is hung in the print department of the Louvre, in Paris. Mrs. Coulter has the singular honor of being the one of three American etchers to be immortalized in the Louvre. , The exhibit is open to students.

senate gets a new constitution Ratification of the new Student Senate constitution by the executive committee of the University unfetters that body from an ultra-conservative, obsolete set of principles of government. The constitution was passed unanimously by the Senate itself just before spring vacation, about six months after the committee had been appointed for drafting it. The old Constitution of the Purdue Student Federation was drawn up several years ago when conservatism was characteristic of University students. The elaborate system of checks and balances included in this document to prevent the Senate from becoming too powerful made important legislation too cumbersome for meeting the rapidly changing desires of a group of students. As a result several provisions of the constitution were completely ignored. The new governing rules, the Constitution of the Purdue Student Senate, omits any mention of the old Student Federation, the Student Union (which has a separate constitution), and the inactive Activities Council, and thus eliminates all the former checks and balances on its actions. Now a system of checks and balances is considered fairly essential by Americans in almost any kind of government, and a perusal of the new constitution might lend the reader the impression that a gross error has been made in this omission. The Purdue Student Senate cannot, however, become autocratic under any constitution. The two groups of persons with which it is most concerned, the administration of the University and the students, will balk moves in that direction. The drafters of the new constitution realized this. Elimination of the Activities Council from the affairs of the Senate legally permits officers of activities connected with it to become candidates for senatorship; however, the former rule forbidding this had not been observed. Representation has been provided also for schools in the University which do not have the major portion of one hundred students required for electing a member to the Senate under the old constitution. Dan Royhans, a newcomer to the Senate, carried out most of the work of revising the constitution, with the advice of Prof. Robert Phillips, faculty advisor of the organization. —R. P. M.
better prospects than 1929—almost This year’s class of seniors may expect to find employment prospects only slightly Jess favorable than those of 1929 graduates, and definitely better than the 1936 class experienced. A survey conducted by the Investor’s Syndicate, of Minneapolis, Minn., shows a continued employment improvement for the last several years. Engineering, business administration, teaching, and general business classifications are offering the greatest number of positions, while law, journalism ,and banking are the least promising fields, according to the results of the survey. Questionnaires filled out by 218 leading colleges and universities situated all over the country are the basis for these findings. These 218 institutions of higher learning account for nearly half of the total male and co-educational collegiate enrollment. One hundred eight-five institutions reported that they expected to place 70 per cent. From 96 schools came the report that engineering jobs were far in the lead, with 83 placing business administration at the top of their lists. Scholarship, personality, campus activity and popularity, character, leadership, and general ability, in the order named, were named most frequently as the first qualifications sought by prospective employers. Scholarship was ranked as first requisite by 51.4 per cent of the institutions, while personality was considered of prime importance by 19.7 per cent.—H. I. S.

m track meet By A. I. Traub After a hard fight, which marked the end of the annual Inter-frater-nity track meet, the Kappa Sigs wound up in the winner’s position with 24 points to their credit. Almost too close for comfort, with a score of 23, were the second place Alpha Chi Rho entries, while the S. A. E.’s finished in third place after lending some pretty keen competition to the meet. Kappa Sigs Star With the 120 yard high hurdles tucked beneath their belt, the Kappa Sigs went on to take first and second place in the 220 yard low hurdles, and then clipped the relay from right under tlie noses of the Alpha Chi Rho entrants. Not satisfied with that amount of the spoils and refusing to take any third place awards, these fieet-footed Greeks went ahead and took a second in the shot put and the 220 yard dash; In a vain effort to beat their opponents to the tape, the men representing Alpha Chi Rho set out to take as many first places as possible with the result that they succeeded in winning the mile run, 440 yard dash, and first and third in the two mile run. Their luck ran low, however, when it came to. placing in the remaining events, for the only second places were in the 100 yard dash and the half mile run, while they placed third in the relay. S. A. K’s Fight To the S. A. E.’s went the laurels for third place, but a lot of fight was apparent as they placed first in the discus throw, pole vault, and tied for top honors in the high jump. Only one of the men brought home a second place and that was in the broad jumpi. Thirds appeared in the following events; the 120 yard high hurdles, the 220 yard low hurdles and the javelin throw.

travel to L u* Indiana University will be the focus for two Purdue sports squads Saturday as the golfers travel south to meet the rival Crimson team and the track combine treks also to Bloomington to meet both Indiana and Northwestern in a triangular meet. Both golf teams have shown good form this year and there should be a good battle arise out of the competition. The track squad also has a good chance of carrying off honors in their fracas, as neither of the other two teams are very strong in the field events, and the Boilermaker runners are able to hold their own.

“I can’t sleep away from the P. D. and Q.—Strange beds, u, , . , youkriow,” ^
^iemeh is no lenm^’—'OrvBy D. Witwer In. the cross flow of a play on words on the way down to the DePauw track meet Wednesday afternoon, Coach “Orv” Martin was heard to say "Lemen is no Lemon,” and he hit the nail right on the head because the boy from Purdue with the name that sounds like that well known citrus fruit went on to win high point honors in the meet by taking the low hurdles and the broad jump and getting a second in the high jump and the high sticks to roll up a total of 16 points. Miss Swimming. T^nt On arriving at the track which was about two inches deep in water, a thick cloud of gloom and regret settled on the Boilermaker trackmen. “Oh, fudge,” said one, (or words to that effect) “we should have brought the swimming team along with us and made a relay meet out of it. We could run the straightaways and they could swim the turns.” But such foresight is denied poor mortals, the events were finally run off after digging the holes along the edge of the track and bailing out the water with several buckets. As the meet progressed it was difficult to tell whether some men were stars or just dubs. If they were stars, their suits were clean, because they were out in front in their races, and if they were dubs their suits were spotless because they didn’t, come into the cloud of spray and mud stirred up by the' leaders until it had time to settle. But such is fate and the onlookers had to use their own judgment. In case you don’t already know it, the final score was 102 to 29 in favor of the Boilermakers.
