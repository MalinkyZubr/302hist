State Track Meet, Hoosiers Second Edwards, Holderman Only Winners As Boilermakers Take Third Place
By Bob Swaim
After three successive years of dominating the state intercollegiate track meet, the Hayes-coached Indiana cinder squad spent most of yesterday afternoon chasing the surprising Notre Dame team around the paths of Ross-Ade stadium. Although the Hoosiers were picked to lengthen their -victory string, the Irish steamrollered through fifteen events, winning six of them. The Irish marked up 68 1-2 points, while the Hoosiers, weakened by the loss of Cochran, scored 46 1-2 points. The third-place Boilermakers totaled 31 points.

Elliott yesterday from Washington, D. C. The University military department has been notified by the Commandant of the Marine Corps in Washington that two additional appointments for commissions in the Marine Corps have been made available to students who have completed the advanced ROTC course with honor rating and who can meet the physical qualifications.

Early Birds, But After The Worm - - Glider Club Members Soar At A AM
By Seymour Lobel To many of the students, spring may be the time of the year when a young man’s fancy turns to baseball—and other kinds of pitching, but to the members of the Purdue Glider Club it is that time of year when soaring potentialities are most prevalent in the vicinity of the campus. , During the Spring months, the club members stagger out of bed at the time when some students manage to stagger home — three o’clock in the morning. At half past three the s^ven members comprising a flight session meet for some breakfast. Early Breakfast At the completion of a hurried snack the men eagerly climb aboard the club’s tow car and drive through the'shaded campus and head for the University airport. Within a quarter hour the men roll the gliders out of the hangar and tow them to the chosen position on the field. At this early hour, wind velocities are usually nil; therefore the ships are placed at any position on the field. The launching wincti is driven to the other end of the field and the tow wire is attached to the ship. By the time the men hear the chimes of Heavilon Hall strike four, the
first flight is usually ready to be logged. The winch is warmed up and the flight manager is already in the ship with his safety belt fastened. The drum is placed in gear and the winch is started up. When the glider’s tail is off the ground, the pilot hauls back the stick and up goes the ship with the rate-of-climb indicator reading 2,500 feet a minute. When a maximum altitude is reached, usually 800 feet, the pilot releases the tow wire. Outstanding Flights During the past semester several outstanding flights have been recorded by Purdue students. Craig Miller, ME ’41, spiraled to 5,200 feet above the airport and remained aloft nearly two hours. Delbert Lewis, ME ’42, on his first day’s gliding in the Glider Club’s new super-sailplane soared to 5,400 feet and landed at Greencastle, 60 miles away. The sam§ afternoon Miller soared 22 miles to Linden in the two-place glider which he designed. This summer the members of the Glider Club will compete in four national soaring meets. They will be held at Witchita Palls, Texas; Frankfort, Michigan; Liberty Corners, New Jersey; Elmira, New York.
Butler, winner of the Little State track meet a week ag;o, ag^ain outclassed the smaller colleges by socring 18% points to win fou;rtli plaee. Remaining scorers were Ball State, 3; Rose Poly, 1%; and DePauw, 1A Thriller Duplicating the stirring race which highlighted last week’s Big Ten conference meet, Ed Holdermap, Boilermaker distance star, and Wayne Tolliver, Hoosier two-miler, battled the last 100 yards of their two-mile event side by side until Holderman, when only a few yar<b from the tape, heaved his lanky body ahead of the Hoosier to win. by a bare two inches. The entire race was run with the two star runners within whispering distance of each other, and for the first mile and a half, another Hoosier, Ed Hedges, kept in the midst of the race. However, the sterling performance of the afternoon must be credited to Brosey, Irish weight-heaver, who hurled the 16 pound shot a distance of 51 feet, 2% inches to smash th^ former record of 50 feet, 6 inches held by Don Elser of Notre Dame. It was the only record set during the program. The shot put event, which was the opener of the meet, was a two-way battle, with Brosey and Harris, giant Hoosier negro, taking turns at tossing the steel ball over the fifty mark. But during the finals the stocky Rambler guided one of his heaves to a spot, which even Harris couldn’t approach. Harris, Weber Place In the preliminaries of the shot put, big Archie Harris surpassed the state record on his first attempt, heaving it 50 feet, 7% inches. Riveter Jake Weber, plainly wasn’t in the form which won second place for him behind Harris in the conference meet, as his best efforts netted only 47 feet, 7 inches, which is more than two feet shy of his performance last week. Highest individual honors were tucked away by Charlie Marshall, Butler co-captain, who topped the field in two events, won a second, and tied for a third. The flashy Bulldog won both hurdle races, placed second in the broad jump, and tied Keeler of Rose Poly for third in the high jump. Marshall apparently didn’t find competition against the “Big Three” much tougher than in last week’s Little State meet, in which he collected four firsts. Edwards Does It A surprise was given Boilermaker fans when Art Edwards, pole vaulter, won his event with a height of 12 feet, 11 14 inches. It was the nearest which the Boilermaker had come to his 13 foot mark set ip an indoor meet last winter. The Boilermaker chances were greatly jan-ed when Ted Tycocki pulled a muscle at the start of one of the preliminary 220 yard dashes. Although scheduled to participate in the broad jump, 100 yard dash, and 220 yard event, Tycocki was unable to perform in any of them. After a strenuous struggle against Ed Holderman, Indiana’s Campbell Kane duplicated his conference one-noile victory by outracing the Boilermaker speedster to the tape after trailing for most of the distance. Kane’s terrific kick at the finish stepped up the time for the event to 4 minutes, 16.7 seconds, after times at the quarter and half mile points had been considerably slower than expected. Rankin Scores Dave Rankin’s versatility produced five points for the Boilermakers. Although he failed to place in the shot put and discus, Dave col(Continued on pago 4)PURDUE EXPONENT

A4r. Roosevelt's Defense Billions Four billions the President has asked of Congress “for defense.” We have not been told as yet just whom we are preparing ourselves for. The answer, of course, is obvious, even if it has not been stated clearly in Washington. The President’s original message to Congress asked for an appropriation of three billions. Thursday, after the battle of Flanders had turned into a very evident Allied rout, the President suddenly announced that he would ask the Congress for an additional billion dollars. We are told that we must have a standing army of a million men, an air force of 50,000 warplanes, a navy twice its present size. Yet—not one military authority has even hinted that an invasion of the United States was militarily possible, supposing, for the sake of argument, that someone wanted to invade this country. There is an ominous note to the dispatches coming from the White House these days. No longer do we hear of national politics, reform measures, pending Congressional legislation. The President talks now only of defense, the navy, the army, a huge air force, and of “fifth column” movements. It seems possible that we are on the eve of a nation-wide witch hunt for “fifth columnists.” Already in Georgia Cover- ^ nor Rivers has announced with great pride that all aliens in his state have been deprived of their license to engage in business or professional occupations. A recent Senate investigation disclosed that the FBI was being used to catalogue thousands of persons “suspected of fifth column activities.” Let Americans understand that no single person or administration can lead us into war. Let us remember that in spite of the fashionable maligning of Woodrow Wilson, we went into the last war of our own desire and free will. Let the President answer the question of what he intends to do with four billion dollars worth of “defenses.” The United States is faced with pressing internal problems which must be solved if we are to be an example to the world. Let us stop this rising war fever before it has infected too many. It is the same old cry being raised; once they called it “manifest destiny,” again it was “save the world for democracy,” and now we hear a familiar ring in “the cause of the Allies is the cause of civilization, the cause of the United States.” —J.L.T.

By Joseph Patrick Dolan And Noble Kizer has put on another swell athletic show, and yesterday’s state track and field for college athletes was it. —-I-I— Those lads participating in the meet were out for fun as well as the coveted medals being dished out by Harley Weehler, one of Purdue’s junior track managers, at the scoring table. After many of the races, the boys got together and talked over the coming football season and the race just completed. _I.I_ This colored 440 man from Indiana, Burnett, running for the injured Cochran, stopped to talk to us after he had surprised the meet’s fans by winning the 440 after a thrilling challenge by Notre Dame’s trio in the event. We asked him where he had been all season, and he replied, “ah just substitutes for Cochran, and I’m a good one, don’t ya thing?” We sure do, kid. _I-I_ We felt mighty sorry for Allan Shackleton, Purdue’s ace 440 man, who was helpless in the 440 dash due to a coalition between Indiana and Notre Dame. “Shack” got caught in a box of N. D. and I. U. athletes and almost stayed there. When he tried to cut loose for the finish, it looked like a hurrying motorist trying to get through Lafayette on Saturday afternoon. —I-I— That two-mile race between Tolliver, of Indiana, and the winner, Eddie Holderman, of Purdue, stole the hearts of true lovers of human
endurance, intestional fortitude (I really mean “guts”), and competi-
tion.
That two mile finish seemed to me a matter of chest expansion with Holderman taking the deepest breath, but that’s hyperbole, because that game little guy from way up north in Michigan had a one foot advantage at the start of the 50 yard sprint—and had it when he finished. —I-I— I also met the No. 1 track and field fan of America at the race. His name is Frank Martin, a big shot insurance man from New York City. He’s got a son who runs a fair long distance race for the ^ Irish, but this Martin guy takes the prize for a track fan. —I-I— Martin worships Greg Rice, Notre Dame alumnus, who runs the mile so fast that the Finns are now rearing some tracksters to revenge the defeat handed to their beloved Taisto Maki by Rice this winter. Martin meets Rice at the train in N. Y., takes him to his meals, and watches over him like a mother hen while the great N. D. runner is performing in Metropolitan. Martin came all the way to Hoosierland to watch his beloved Notre Dame crash through with a surprise win. Now the old boy can sleep tonight on that Pullman. —I-I— We talked to the Notre Dame track coach for a while, and that kid’s got a job ahead of him. He has succeeded the great Nicholson, who passed away this last winter. The new coach is an Irishman titled Bill Mahoney, and if you are ask’n me, which ya ain’t, he’s did a swell job o’ fillin’ a great man’s shoes.

Members Of Five Teams Given letters; Barbara Cook Receives Special Award
Letter awards to the members of the Boilermaker varsity and freshmen varsity baseball, tennis, golf, and pistol squads were awarded Wednesday afternoon following approval by the insignia board of the Student Athletic Association. Additional awards in football for improved performances during spring practice were also announced. Numeral honors in track will be presented Monday following final achievements in the state track meet which was held here yesterday. For the first time in history the ■
Recently elected Boilermaker track captain, Ed Holderman captured the two mile run and finished second in the mile event to take individual point-scoring laurels on
the Riveter squad.
But what’s too big for the Irish? It is not!
—I-I—
It was a grand day; the announcer. Bob Woodworth’s mike performance was laudable, Howard Wilkening’s job as clerk of course was so well done that there wasn’t a dull moment—and for me, Purdue, and Pa Rankin, sitting in the stands, Dave Rankin beat that Denny fellow of Indiana, and it wasn’t an illusion! ' -1-1— Until the last publication it’s “30.”
insignia board officially recognized the athletic accomplishment of a co-ed when they presented a special certificate of achievement to Barbara Cook, of Jeffersonville, senior in the science school. Barbara, diminutive diver, has been one of the nation’s leading divers during her four years at school.
