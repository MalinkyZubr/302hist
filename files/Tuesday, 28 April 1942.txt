Notice To Faculty The following: is a repnnt of a na4iM sent from the office of the President tA members of the instructional staff. You are reminded that the regular second semester schedule of classes must be carried out IIP until Saturday, May 2, at noon This schedule applies with special force to those clashes taken mainly by seniors, for whom grades are to be submit-i’ ted on April 27. It is your responsibility to make the work ef the last few days of next week sufficiently important to hold the interest and attendance of students up to the very end. The Executive Committee at its meeting on April 20 declared Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, April 29, 30, May 1 and 2 to be penalty dates for all undergraduate students who are not candidates for degrees. Candidates for degrees are not included under this action solely because of the impossibility of assessing and collecting the penalty tee prior to Commencement. Absences of such candidates should, however, be reported. In reporting absences unusual regard for accuracy should be observed Edward C. Elliott President
