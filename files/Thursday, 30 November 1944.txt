Seeing some sorority girls scribbling a certsiih name Over and over again on slips of paper during a recent class period brought us to the sudden realization that elections for Queen of the Riveters’ R^ssle are imminent. ^ Our first impulse was to say, “Rook here/ don’t you realize that in these days of specialization, of machinery, of mas^ production, work done by ‘loving hands at home’ falls to the level of the sub-marginal producer?’’ The futility of their efforts was pathetic. , For this is the annual occasion for a mimeograph election. The fashionable ballot box is a bushel basket, and book store proprietors break the news to the Ardent Booster that Ohe sold his last ream of paper this morning. Voites mount up into the millions, to the accompaniment of the moans of the enthusiast ^i Without a mimeograph machine. ' Ballot box stuffing for Riveters’ Rassle elee34 tions is- as tirMitidhal here as green pots and fhAQ lUsnot the sort of , thing to go stuffily hioralistic about. We get U big kick out of it. ' That is, we got a big kick out of it The idea isn’t so very novel any more, and we greeted with only luke warm enthusiasm the news that Riveter Rassle elections will be legal this year—^to the extent thut the slacks of paper will be weighed and the number of names on each minfxeographed sheet ■■-’determined.. ’i. There's nothing exciting ahput seeing which group can run a mimeograph the fast-:T‘e^tl&;A--"-A ; ■ Far be it from us to go righteous and suggest a passport election. However, some revision is in order. “This is war,” we’ve been hearing for quite some time. We see in tbe news reels pictures of Boy Scouts collecting paper fpr a paper drive. And then we remember last year when the Ardent Boosters brought in their bushels and bushels and bflahels of votes. , T^e Booster should have profilered more from his course in “Time and Motion studies.” It’s a shame to waste paper by the ream at any time. But when the government asks for conservation? . Tain’t funny.—p.m.
