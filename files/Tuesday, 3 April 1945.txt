We think that the editors of the Exponent have done a thorough joh in showing why a chapei‘ i^’t adequate. The present channels of worship are sufficient to meet the heeds of stui&nts,; today and in the future. ' Another suggestion is an apartment house for returning G, L’s and their wives. The Unir versity has already provided for this need in its future plans. The next constructive idea is that of a research laboratory. If Purdue University is to maintain its rank as a leading Universityj it research facilities through its regular channels. The Purdue Research Foundation is such a channel. Another progressive project is that of expahsioh of the Purdue Library. We agree that our present library is inadequate, for the , needs of the future. Again we point^^out that the. library is an integral part of the University,, and that its improyeihent and exr paosion is being; providedi for by the University; We were indeed surprised that the editors bf the Exponent looked favorably upon the suggestion of a carillon. This is ridiculous! The-only purpose of such a project iSi toiaidi another halo of tradition to the -Universityi;, Is^this a worthy trihide to, thosie swhofc ffi sd'that their children might live in a saner world?
