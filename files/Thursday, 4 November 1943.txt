The Washington Merry-Go-Round By Drew Pearson Paper Salvage Lags, Need Grows Acute; Sugar Barons Accu$e Medical Experts Of Threatening Market Washington — One contributing factor in the increasing paper shortage has been lack of “boypower” to collect scrap paper, plus lack of a War Production sparkplug to get a paper campaign humming. ’ What happened was that shortly after Pearl Harbor, housewives and youngsters collected scrap paper with such zeal that scrap dealers were not able to take care of it, reduced the price, sent word out that no more paper was needed. American patriotism was too much for the unorganized scrap industry and government. At that time scrap paper was not so urgently needed. But now the situation daily grows more acute. Most scrap paper is made into cardboard or heavy pasteboard packing boxes, much of it used to send war goods abroad. When enough scrap paper is not available for V-boxes, then they are made of raw wood pulp, thus taking newsprint away from the daily newspapers. Belatedly, therefore, the War Production Board has begun tQ stir itself regarding paper salvage. Its inei’tia has been as bad as its initial failure regarding scrap iron. But that does not make the paper less needed. Actually Uncle Sam needs 8,000,000 tons of scrap paper. Thei’e is a saying that nothing is as dead as yesterday’s newspaper. Bi^t now any old newspaper is alive for sci'ap purposes. All sorts of paper is needed—cigarette packages, candy boxes, paper cups, newspapers—everything. Scrap paper actually is in such demand that one biscuit company had to shut down because it was unable to get paper boxes. It is so short that a black market has sprung up. Imagine a year ago, bootlegging waste paper! Senatorial Courtesy One of the oldest subterfuges practiced in the name of “senatorial dignity” is the deletion of acrimonious debate from the Congressional Record. However, Florida’s forthright young Claude Pepper is one Senator who believes.in keeping the recoi’d straight, regardless of whom it hits. Pepper recently had a fiery exchange with Texas’ Chairman Tom Conpally of the foreign relations committee over changes in the postwar peace resolution, during which the Texan roared that he had been “insulted.” Later Connally went to Pepper, suggested the flareup be stricken from the Record. “I’ll have to look it over to see if there’s anything wrong in it,” said the able Floridan, who is one-eighth Indian. He made it clear he didn’t want to tamper with the record and expressed doubts as to what parts of the debate should be deleted. But Connally was persistent. “Let’s take it all out,” urged the Texan. Pepper, however, refused to consent to any changes at all. Next day his row with Connally appeared unexpurgated. There was only one grammatical correction, made by Congressional Record reporters. At one point Connally, in high temper, forgot himself and exclaimed, “—it ain’t so.” Reporters changed this to, “—it is not so.” How Sweet Is Sugar The sugar shortage has raised a battle behind the scenes between medical experts and the sugar industry regarding the true value of sugar. The sugar bai’ons are aroused to a fighting pitch, and are spending handsome hunks of dough to prevent the American public from being weaned gway from su-i
gar.
Current shortages have reduced sugar sharply in the American diet, but the medical profession has stepped forward to reassure the public that all is well, that the sacrifice will not injure health. Even the conservative American Medical Association, through its cohimittee on nutrition, has come out with articles in the AM A Journal, casting doubts on the value of sugar as normally consumed in this country. It suggests that soft drinks, lollypops, the bedside box of candy, the three heaping teaspoons in the coffee cup are not exactly essential to winning the war. The medicos do not question that sugar provides energy, but they do suggest that America’s “excessive;” use of sugar could be reduced without harm to the nation’s health. Reassuring as this may be to the public, it has the opposite effect on the sugar industry. The barons, led by New York sugar brokerSj. Lamborn & Co., have organized an “Institute” to combat the “dangerous” influence of the American Medical Association.

Duo-Pianists Will Appear In Music Hall
New Students Take Orientation Tests
Students To Gain Admission By Showing Receipt For Fees; Doors Will Open At 7
New students were welcomed to the campus in a special convocation held yesterday at 8:00 in the Hall of Music. Contrary to normal peacetime conditions, there are 160 freshman women and only 100 men. New Navy and Marine V-12’s, totaling 295, will register with the regular students. Also, 560 new/ASTP’s are scheduled to arrive this week and enter the University. Dean Hockema, Dean Goldsmith, Dean Coolidge and Registrar Stone each gave a short welcoming address before the orientation tests began. A1 Stewart led the community singing and then C. E. Dammon, master of ceremonies for the tests, took over. Given Tests Freshmen and new students were given a psychological exam and quizzed in English. Afternoon exams in composition and math completed the confusion felt by the entering freshmen. Today the only tests scheduled are a test of aptitude for physical sciences .and the physical examinations, which will continue throughout the day according to pre-ar-ranged plans given on the green schedule paper given to all new students. Friday and Saturday all students, new and old, will register in the Armory, beginning at 8 and continuing until 4 on Friday and 2:30 on Saturday. Freshmen will register according to the time allotted to their student numbers, not alphabetically. 3(H) New V-12 Cadets, 383 ATS's Arrive Here To Start Winter Term Nearly 300 sailors and marines arrived on the campus Monday as new enrollees in the V-12 training program. The majority of the men are replacements for the V-12 students who completed their college training last week. The group includes 70 men who have seen action in the South Pacific or other battle areas and have just returned from sea duty. Theta Chi and Phi Kappa Psi, two of the eleven fraternity houses taken over by the navy, will be transferred from the marines to the sailors in order to take care of the increased number of bluejackets. There are only 13 marines in the incoming group. At the end of the past term, 219 AST students were assigned to duties in other zones while it is definitely known that 383 new AST soldiers will be entered in school for the winter teym. This number is only temporary, however, as more are expected before classes actually
begin.
Two British Housing Authorities Make Visit To University Two noted British housing authorities, Sir James West, chief architect of the Ministry of Works and director of post-war biulding, and Alfred Bossom, member of Parliament and chairman of the committee of both Lords and Cominoqs that takes action in connection with building, visited the University last week to inspect the housing leseaich work. These men conferred with G. Stanley Meikle, director of the Research Foundation, and Carl Boester, in charge of the housing reseai’ch project, on war time housing and inspected the low cost homes erected the last year or two on the research campus. They were much impressed by their visit to the University and spoke highly of the practicable nature of the work being done here on housing. They went fiom here to Fort Wayne and they are visiting a number of cities over the country inspectng housing projects.

Recreation Has Its Part In Vl/ar, PeaceSays Servel Personnel Director Roberts “Recreation is a hard-boiled ndc- ■ ——————
essity both in times of war and peace,” declared H. 0. Roberts, personnel director of Servel, Inc., Evansville, in the opening address this afternoon before the Industrial Recreation Clinic at the University. Speaking before close to 60 leaders in the field from 12 states, Roberts said: “Men and women, especially those new to industiy working at high speed tempo, living too often in overcrowded quarters, seek and need release from tension at the end of the work shift. Recreation guards human waste on the home front as it does on the battle
front.
“Tired and dull workers are dangeious to themselves, others end production,” he added. “Accidents often come from fatigue and worry. Both are relieved to a degree by relaxation through pioper recrea-
tion.”
A Force Against Absenteeism Robeits declared that proper recleation is a poweiful force against’ absenteeism, and emphasized his belief that post-war planning should definitely include recreation. The pioneering clinic, the first of its kind in the country, was opened with addiesses of welcome from President. E. C. Elliott and Guy Mackey, director of the division of physical education for men. Discussion of Roberts’ address was led by L. C. Ripley, director of welfare activities of the Wright Aeionautical Corp., Cincinnati, Ohio, and Ray Wood, personnel manager. Aluminum Co. of America, Lafay-
ette.
Dr. Arthur Sleinhaus, research physiologist, George Williams College, Chicago, will speak on “Worker Fatigue and Recreation” before

War Fund Drive Lags; Two Weeks Added To Initial Contribution Time The War Fund Drive, which staited very successfully, has bogged down because of the vacation taking many of the faculty and staff out of town. Although it was expected to close last week it will have to be conducted for probably two more weeks. Up to now, $10,927 has been turned in by the faculty and staff All faculty or employees of the University who received pledge cards from the War Fund and Community Fund ^Drives are requested to turn them in as quickly as possible to the President’s office. ^ of the University. It will probably have passed the $11,000 mark by the time the Exponent has gone to press. Prof. C. W. Beese, head of faculty and staff donations, urges all those who haven’t returned their pledge cards as yet to do so as soon as is possible. ' Businessmen Behind Drive The businessmen of West Lafayette have turned in $1,300 up to the present time. The businessmen have really put their backs behind this drive and have contributed to the
full.
Lt. J. A. Andrade is to conduct the drive as far as the ASTP is concei'ned as soon as they return from their furlough. Lt. A. P. Lewis is the sub-chairman in charge of the drive for the airport personnel and Lt. Lee Sommers is handling the drive for the V-12’s and Electrician Mates. The campaign for the rest of the county is going slowly because of the farmers not having finished their harvesting. In spite of all this the drive is supposed to go well over the quota set for the drive. Late Staff Member Writes Of Her Life As Red Cross Nurse Miss Isabel Diehl, who resigned her position on the home economics state at the University last year to join the Red Cross Nursing Force, has been stationed in Australia, and writes of hpr life there. At her base hospital they are caring for casualties, working from 12 to 14 hours a day during the busy times and six hours a day during slack times which occur when the patients have lecovered or are returned to the states. She says about her patients: “They all want to tell their life story, past and future, with the girl’s picture, mother’s picture and often the sister’s picture.” She tells of important visitors to their hospital such as Under-Sec-retary of the Navy Patterson, General William Knudsen and Mrs. Roosevelt. “Mrs. Roosevelt gave the boys a little pep talk and expressed the country’s appreciation for what the patients had done. She was quite well received.” Miss Diehl’s work consists of supervision of the care for patients and some bedside work.
State ASME To Hear National President Nov. 10; Will Speak Here November 11 Harold V.

Caldwell Heads Botany Dept. Dr. Edward C. Elliott, president of the University, has announced the creation of a Department Of Botany in the School of Agriculture. This announcement was made after formal approval by the Board of Trustees of the University at a meeting last week. Under the new arrangement the teaching of botany is shifted from the Department of Agronomy, where it has been for many years, to the newly created Department of Botany. Dr. Ralph M. Caldwell, head of the Depai-tment of Botany and Plant Pathology of the Agricultural Experiment Station, will be in charge of this depai-tment.
Eugenia Honeywell and Harold Bauer will appear in a duo-piano recital Saturday evening at 7:30 in the Music Hall to continue the present series of University convocations. Doors will be opened at 7 and students will be admitted upon presentation of their receipt for University fees. Service men may gam admission by showing their recration identification card. Tickets for the general public may be purchased at the door for $1.10, including tax. Eugenia Honeywell is an Indiana pianist who, although she terms herself an amateur, has played from coast to coast. She maintains her amateux- standing by donating all fees earned to educational, cultural or charitable causes. Mrs. Honeywell is also active in the business world by virtue of her management of a chain of mid-west newspapers. Bauer was the co-originator of the' two-piano recital which has been popular in this country recently. He was born in England but has been a citizen of this country since 1921 where he made his debut with the Boston Symphony. Last season both he and Mrs. Honeywell acted as soloists for the Miami Symphony. Ag School To Exhibit Livestock At Chicago Fair November 29 The University will be among the Indiana exhibitors at the forthcoming Chicago market fat stock and carlot competition, to be held at the Chicago Stock Yards November 29 through December 2, with 15 head of wether lambs and 39 head of barrows.

The University has won many of the top awards in the fat classes at past Internationals, their winnings at the last full show in 1941 including the steer grand championship on the Angus-Shorthorn crossbred Loyal Alumnus IV. The market show will include all of ■ the fat classes that have been featured at the Interntaionnal show in past years. According to the management, entries for the individual classes will close on November 1 and for the carload lots on November 20.

YoUr shirts are valuable items theRe days and appreciate special handling.
Turn up your shirt collar before sending it to the laundry. A collar washed flat doesn’t fray BO easily at the crease.
Have your shirts laundered frequently. A too* soiled shirt retjuires more scrubbing and conse* quently wears out more quickly.
Go easy on the starch. Starching stiffens fabric, so that it breaks instead of bending.
When you buy, buy Arrow. Arrow shirts are longer-lasting, better-fitting, and carry the Sanforized label (fabric shrinkage less than 1%).
