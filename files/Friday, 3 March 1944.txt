WASHINGTON—At the 1940 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Henry Wallace ducked a pho- ' tograph—ah incident which he has- since lived -to
i'egret.
He was sitting with Mayer Ed Kelly, hoSs <rf Cihi* ■■ c^gq, and Mayor (“I Am the Law”) Hague, boss of Jersey City, when a cameraman i^proached. .'^ee^jiig hi^j the future Vice President s^uMenly got up i^nd jlucfced out "o’f tilie picture, Jtte niadhj.no secret of i^e fact ,that i^e pot want to, be photographed with the two powerful Democratic bosses. Last January, Hague and Kelly were in Washington j^t the Jackson Day dinner and, afjterward^ wi^ile reminiscing about o^d tiips, recalled^this incident. But they did not know that the pendulum of fato would swing in their.directiqn very soon. tprning from * political speaking tour through the West, stopped in Chicago and deferentially called lon Mayor Kelly to 'fiay his respects. ' And this ttime, it was Mayor Ketly who refused to h^ve his picture ta^n with the Vice President of the
United States.
