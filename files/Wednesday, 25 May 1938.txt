Apprentice Players is the name of the newly organized under-study group. In the future all Play Shop members must receive their preliminary training, until accepted by the Play Shop, in this Apprentice Players group. “Pills and Needles,” the recent New York smash hit, will be seen by 22 members of the Play Shop Saturday evening, June 4. The group will see the presentation at Chicago’s Grand Opera, and will also be feted to a dinner in one of the better hotels. Members Honored Eight outstanding members of the organization were honored, receiving either a bronze, silver or gold medal. Receiving the highest award, a gold medal in the shape of the dramatic emblem, were Harry Brenman and Bernard Everett. The award was given for the most significant work done, and the greatest contribution to the organization in four years time, respectively. Silver medals were given to three outstanding men for this year’s endeavors. The medals were given to Vic Somogyi and Benny Burns for the season’s greatest all around contribution; and to Shorty Miller for the season’s greatest technical achievement. Bronze medals went to Bob Heine and Gil Devore for the season’s best major and minor role respectively, and to Elizabeth Able for the greatest improvement in rehearsal. Seventy-eight members of Play Shop received shingles for this year. Forty-four of them received silver shingles and 34 received gold ones.

'Roosevelt Has Not Lost Popularity'-Prof. Murphy “Collectivism is supplanting individualism,” said Prof. Charles B. Murphy, of the history, economics, and government department, who spoke on current events at the WSGA mass meeting yesterday afternoon in the women’s lounge of the Union Building. “Evidence of this statement is the remarkable fact that Roosevelt has not lost personal popularity in the face of recession. The reason is that the people are even more left-wing than Roosevelt. Therefore, they are supporting him rather than the return of haphazard “laissez-faire” conditions in business, Mary Alice Learning, President of WSGA, introduced tl>e new oflteers and board members at the meeting.
McCabe, Lafayette lawyer and Delta Tau Delta advisor, opened the program at 7:30 with an address on “Sizing Up the Individual.” Professor McKee of the English department followed with an explanation of “How to Write a Letter to a Prospect,” and R. N. Horn of the speech department closed the session with a discussion on “How To Interview a Prospect.” McCabe advised the fraternity men to be frank and to the point in asking questions of rushees, still being as diplomatic as possible. He said that intelligent rushing required “the application of what seems to me just plain, ordinary common sense.” Selling Points Professor McKee pointed out that competition for rushees today was not wholly among the various fraternities themselves, but also in a larger sense against independent living. He named the cardinal selling points as “bed, board, study, society, and advertisement of the University.” Horn explained that in the personal interview each fraternity should point out its own individual characteristics as they appealed to the rushee; the “angle of sociability,” activities, scholarship, athletics and fraternal advantages. He advised all to “treat matters of expenses honestly, making every financial requirement clear.” Second Session The second session at 7:30 tomorrow night in the Union ballroom will conclude the Rush School program. C. E. Dammon, Prof. F. C. Hockema, Tom Sheets, and R. B. Stewart will address the group at this time. Substitute Mixer For Union Formal Bud Bryant and his sophisticated swingsters will play for a mixer to be held in the Union ballroom Friday night from 9 to 12 o’clock. The dance will take the place of the Union summer formal which was originally planned for that evening, although the same orchestra will be featured according to Vincent Hruby, Union vice-president in charge. In addition, the usual Saturday night mixer will be held. Placement Head Seeks Co-ed Jobs Vocational opportunities for college women will be the object of a three-day trip to Chicago on which Miss Ruth Houghton, head of the University placement service for women, left yesterday. Miss Houghton will investigate opportunities in hospitals for science and pharmacy students in this city. Openings in publishing houses will be the object of a visit to Scott, Foresman and Company, and R. R. Donnelly and Sons. A trip to the Encyclopedia Britannica publishing house will furnish information on research jobs and secretarial positions, while opportunities for those trained in home economics and business will prompt visits to Chicago department stores. “I am making the trip to obtain vocational information about training as well as to secure specific openings for present graduates,” added Miss Houghton.

For instance, we have been laboring' for a long time under the delusion that the. average ed is rather money conscious and inclined to be poorly padded in the vicinity of fhe left hip pocket. We never suspected that Purdue could be a spendthrift’s school. And then yesterday Debris editors told us that 498 yearbooks are still waiting in their office to be distributed. That didn’t amaze us, but when we heard that 300 of those books had been fully paid for we were a little shocked. It never occurred to us that there might be those among us who could pay four or five dollars for a Debris, and then forget about it or neglect to collect said book within the eight days it has been available.

Since the origin of this service in 1933, WSGA has each year made improvements in its plans for the work. _ Gradually more and more of the responsibility for new students has been given aver to the co-ed student counselors. This spring it was decided that only sophomores and juniors should serve as counselors— the feeling being that they were a little better acquainted with Purdue and therefore more logical material. The committee in its training plans cooperated with those in charge of the men’s counseling program in a series of instructional lectures. Following these lectures each applicant for a counselorship was personally interviewed in order that the committee might get her opinions and her criticisms of former programs. On the basis of these interviews and the applicants’ scholastic records 120 counselors were chosen for active duty next fall. After the roster was announced small discussion groups were held for these girls on two different days. At these meetings each co-ed was given a mimeographed copy of the facts in 12 typical problem cases. The whole group then discussed the

How About Another Book Exchange? Dear Editor: The development this year of the Student Book Exchange was one of the few really worthwhile enterprises I have seen students during my four years at Pui’due. During these years I have bought and sold a good many books, donating a little money in each transaction to the bookstores as commission. When the Book Exchange came along last semester I took advantage of the service as did many of my classmates, and found that I saved up to 20 per cent on both sales and purchases. I sincerely appreciated the opportunity to do this, but nevertheless, I am a little disappointed now. Since I hope to graduate in June I won’t be able to use the Exchange again. Because of this I feel as if I had been cheated a little. I’ll have several books to sell at the end of this semester too, but so far I haven’t heard of a chance to sell them through the Exchange. Will seniors be able to leave books at the Union to be sold next fall ? In case no provision is made for doing this I might want to leave my texts with some undergraduate so that he can sell them for me through the Exchange next year. Will the Exchange accept senior books then? Will it .accept books offered for sale-by anyone but the owner ? Or will I just have to take my books to the village again and lose 20 per cent on the deal? C. W. Dudding, ChE ’38.
During the last hour of the first day trials, the railbirds were royally entei’tained. The showman was the chubby 1935 winner, Kelly Petillo. The car, his own creation with a model A radiator cap. It’s a nonsupercharged job with a supercharger.
How’s That? Well, Kelly says he always carries his super with him. It’s his small right foot with plenty of pressure behind it. That’s the answer, too, because he buzzed around for nine laps at better than 127.5. Just four hundred yards to the photo-electric starting line his right tire blew out. At thalt time he was moving between 145 and 150.
Someone yelled, “Here he comes look out!” I left. Tire or no tire, he maintained a perfect course and came in on one hot flat. He had new tires on the left side of his car but old ones on the right. Lady Luck wasn’t touring with him.
Editor’s Note: It will not be possible for seniors or any other students to leave books with the Exchange to be sold next fall. Senior books will be welcomed for sale at that time, however, and it will be perfectly legitimate to have a friend sell them for yon.
Sunday he changed from 700x16 tires to 750’s on the rear. With pole position gone, he was out for $1200 gift money to be given by an oil company and a parts company to the driver making the fastest, time. His first lap was about 124.5 m.p.h. and his second 130.3! Motor trouble developed and his second of three permitted trials was lost. Tony Gulotta drove his mount into the second row of the starting lineup completing his 10 laps just in time to beat the rain. He is driving the car which Lou Meyer drove to victory in 1936 and Ralph Hepburn placed Second with last year. Tony thinks his car has about three m.p.h. more speed than last year, two for additional streamlining and one for motor improvements. She will do 123 tops now, he says.
AGR^s Meet Phi DelV^ Today In Frat Ball Finals By defeating Sigma Alpha Epsilon, 3-0, yesterday afternoon on Intramural Field, the Alpha Gamma Rho baseball squad became the representatives of the winners bracket in the current interfraternity baseball tourney. The Phi Delta Theta nine defeated the Tan Epsilon Phi squad, 11-4, to win the losers bracket. The two nines will meet this afternoon on Intramural Field. If the Alpha Gamma Rho’s win they will be declared the fraternity champions, but should the Phi Delt’s win today’s game, a second game must be played to decide the winner, said “Chief” Clevett last night. The Phi Delts have lost one game and must win both games to become the ’38 interfraternity baseball champions.
How about some chatter on racing tires ? They are made in sizes similar to passenger car tires. The amount of air pressure varies, of course, with the size; usually about 38 pounds. They cost around $18 per tire and you can buy them just as the race car owners do. The tires are filled with nitrogen instead of air. Because of its relative inactivity, it refuses to expand with tire running heat and thus a more constant pressure is maintained. Most of the tires are of the six-ply variety.

‘Every little squeak, the Doc brings his car in here—he’s getting to be a regular hypochondriac !”
Rushing through meals is contrary to the rules of good health. Relax a bit during the noon hour. Take time to eat lunch slowly. The smokers will find that they have time for their cigarettes after the lunch. Plan work so that a leisurely lunch time is possible. Forget about morning class problems and take things easy. Students will find that they will go to their afternoon classes and labs in an easier frame of mind, rested and refreshed during the noon hour instead of being worried by the press of time.
By Joy Johnson The noon hour, in many cases, seems to be as hectic a time as the rest of the day. Everyone gulps down ,a lunch in order to spend 20 minutes or so getting ready for afternoon classes or playing bridge. Fraternity dining rooms are emptied in 15 minutes. Sororities run a close second. In boarding houses and in the Union cafeteria the same situation is observed. Why not make the lunch hour a social hour. Work can be planned so that there are no little odds and ends to take care of during that time.
“If education is in anyway to blame for the present world mess, it is because certain branches have outstripped others and have become lopsided and wobbly. No one can criticize the prodigious strides of the physical sciences. The trouble lies with the laggards, the social sciences.” Harold O. Vorhis, New York University, believed a forward shove should be given those who lag behind.
SUMMER EMPLOYMENT FOR STUDENTS The Circulation and Sales Division of the publishers of Good Housekeeping, Cosmopolitan, Harper’s Bazaar and Pictorial Review offers an unusual opportunity for sumiher employment to students interested in selling experience to act as traveling sales representatives and crew managers. Previous selling experience helpful but not required. The work is under contract for a period of twelve weeks providing a weekly salary, transportation and a bonus of $175,000 at the end of the twelve week period. See J. A.

Graham Wins Annual River Swim; Breaks Own Record
Tredwell Finishes In Second Position; Krick, Arnold, Harris, Agonis Follow
Johnny Graham, lanky sophomore merman, chopped his way through icy Wabash River waters yesterday afternoon to capture blue ribbon honors in the annual University river swim for the second consecutive year. Graham’s time was 21:57 minutes, which clipped 58 seconds oif the' record he marked up for the course last year. "
“Chief” Clevett, of the intramural
department, said last night.
Fehringmen To Face Chicago's Maroons Today
Gilman Tredwell, who finished 30 yards behind Graham, and the only back stroker in the group of 18 swimmers splashed his way through the muddy water to win second position. H. Krick grabbed third place honors with C. D. Arnold winning
fourth position. Close Finish
T. A. Harris and Henry A. Agonis, swimming neck and neck during the two and a half mile grind, furnished the 300 or so spectators with the outstanding thrill of the event. Harris nosed out Agonis in the last five yards to win fifth place. Pushed by a three-mile current which had a temperature reading of 62 degrees, 15 men finished the race from Lincoln Lodge to the Brown Street levee bridge. Three men dropped out before the first mile mark was reached because of severely cramped muscles. Graham To Receive Award “Graham will receive a statuette for winning first place, and the next five men will be awarded medals,”
Trackmen Choose Bodeau, Halfmiler, For Team Leader Art Bodeau, crack Boilermaker half miler was selected by his trackmates yesterday to lead them during the 1939 season. Following the voting the Varsity easily won the Varsity-freshmen track meet by a score of 65 to 28, but the freshmen took four firsts, all of them in field events in which the Boilermakers have failed to score very heavily this season. Among the most notable performers for the freshmen were Tykocki, who broadjumped 22 feet 11 inches, and Weber who put the shot a distance of 45 feet 4 and 1-2 inches.

Present Ball Team Leaves Imposing Record To Shoot At With only three games yet to be played, one of the best seasons in the history of Boilermaker baseball will soon be finished, leaving an array of imposing statistics for future diamond teams to shoot at. With a fielding percentage of .940 and a batting average of .249 for the entire team, it is easy to understand why the Purdue squad has ranked among the Big Ten leaders all season. Surprise Surprise boy of the squad has been Felix Mackiewicz, who stepped up from left field after one year on “Pop” Doan’s freshman squad, to fill the shoes of Red Breslin, when the hard hitting team captain was forced to the bench with a broken ankle early in the season. Never missing a game, the South Side Chicago boy, took over Bres-
lin’s duties at third base and has established himself as one of the best players in the Big Ten in one season. Most consistent hitter on the Boilermaker squad, Mackiewicz has also turned in a fine performance in the infield, handling 77 chances with only 10 errors. Thompson and Heai-ne have also made an imposing record in the infield. Their play at the important keystone corner has been exceptionally good all season. Hearne, another sophomore, has made only three errors during his season’s play at Second base. Thompson, in addition to his excellent play at the shortstop position has come through with several good hits in crucial
moments.
Establishes Record Waling, playing his first year at the initial bag, has established a record of 180 fielding chances with only two errors. Stamm, Dean, and Dickinson, represent probably the fastest outfield in the Conference. Their fine hitting ability and excellent field pla^ has been a source of inspiration to the team all season. All three will be returning to the squad next year.

Boilermaker Battery Consists Of Mangas, Krause; Uses Regular Starting Lineup For Big Ten Contest With their eyes still resting on the Big Ten championship, Coach “Dutch” Fehring and his Boilermaker baseball squad entrained for Chicago this morning at 8 o’clock to battle the Chicago Maroons this afternoon in the Windy City.
Carroll Mangas, Purdue ace right ' hander, will be Coach Fehring’s choice to handle the mound duties for the afternoon with “Moose” Krause receiving. Krause’s recent return to the heavy hitting ranks has definitely placed him in the
starting lineup. Chicago Loses Two
Last week Chicago dropped to seventh place due to stinging defeats at the hands of the Hawkeyes of Iowa. The Hawks captured the first game 14-6, and shut out the Maroons, 6-0, in the second encounter between the two clubs. While Iowa was taking the Chicago nine into camp, the Boilermakers were being held to a split by the Ohio State Buckeyes, which dropped the Gold and Blacks to third place and lifted the Iowa diamondmen to second place one-half game behind the league-leading In-
diana club.
The Boilermakers, athletic critics say, are far from out of the pennant scramble, because the Iowa squad journeys to Ohio State for two games and must face the Minnesota nine twice before their season is completed. Indiana must face the Boilermakers in a critical three game series this week-end-at Pur-
due.
