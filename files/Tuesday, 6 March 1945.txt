He pointed out that he had already put the Southern Pacific to great trouble and he couldn’t, bother them further. But Eaiser^s speretary was adamant. Her chief must ride in the yellow cars. What Kaiser had in mind was that gray Pullmans from the overland limited sometimes are hooked on to the yellow streamlinei-, and he didn’t want to ride in thefec gray cars. 7 So the Southern Pacific finaUfir sent a runner across the bay to its yards in Oakland pn Saturday before the train left to make sure that the train was made up so that Mr, KAiser’s thrae connecting bedrooms ■were in a yellow car.
