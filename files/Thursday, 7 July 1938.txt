“The small group that has built up and operates industry must be given a chance to survive,” asserted Dr. Dexter S. Kimball, dean emeritus of Cornell University engineering, to a convocation audience of 500 in Eliza Fowler Hall Tuesday morning. Industrial progress is carried on the shoulders of a few . . . civilization advances by individuals rather than by groups .. . hope of civilization rests on a relatively small number of men, inventors such as Edison, industrialists such as Ford, management engineers such as Frederick Taylor—said aging, grayhaired Dean Kimball.
“Examine These Phrases” In his discussion of modern catchwprds, including “social justice,” the convocation lecturer hit at labor organization leaders and other speakers who “think emotionally” and have “no knowledge of the background of industry.” “Examine these phrases and hope that the Lord will send us wise, able leaders,” concluded Kimball. Next convocation speaker is Dr. E. L. Thorndike, Columbia University psychologist, author, and educator, who will talk in Eliza Fowler Hall at 10 o'clock next Thursday morning.
Dr. J. B. Edmonson Dr. E. L. Thorndike, top, will be convocation speaker next Tuesday morning at 10 o’clock on the subject “Education and the Good Life.” Dr. E. S. Conklin will lead a forum that afternoon on “We Are Not Yet Prepared for Guidance.” W. H. Johnson, third from top, speaks at the opening session of the Educational Leaders’ Clinic Monday on the topic “The Theory and Practice of Vocational Education,” while Dr. J. B. Edmonson will talk Tuesday afterpoon about “pressure groups.” Thorndike and Conklin will also take part in the clinic program.
What Is Social Justice? (Extract of talk by Dr. Dexter S. Kimball at Tuesday morning’s convo) Slogans and catchwords have from time immemorial accompanied efforts to sway men’s minds and our age is no exception in this respect. Who does not remember Theodore Roosevelt’s “Square Deal” and Woodrow Wilson’s “New Freedom,” which preceded the “New Deal” of the present administration ? In general these slogans are vague in their intent and rarely define the issues that they represent with any degree of accuracy. Yet in their day they are often powerful instruments in swaying the minds of the uninformed and careless thinker, and they never suggest the price at which the results they advocate must be bought. And all good things on this earth must be paid for in one way or another. How Much Will It Cost? Thus “Social Security” which suggests an end that all desire appears at present in the form of old age pensions and such governmental organizations as the PWA. But we have little idea what the final financial cost of this movement will be and less of the long run effect upon the morale and mental stamina of those who presumably will be benefitted. And now appears a time old idea under the slogan of “Social Justice.” It is in the mouth of all present day reformers and aggressive labor leaders, and no doubt expresses a social idea to which we would all agree. But any effort to define social justice in concrete terms raises a host of most difficult problems and none is more perplexing than the question of wages and rewards for service to society. The new wage and hour law can be jujstified in principle, whether it is economically sound or not as a protective measure for the low scale workers. Incidentally, such legislation is very ancient, the first recorded wage laws being those Of the Babylonian King Hammurabi, promulgated over 400 years ago. Can Any Man Earn A Million? When we undertake to extend the idea to higher callings, the problem becomes extremely complex. Thus the writer has frequently heard it said that no man is worth $1,000,000 a year to society. But I find it very difficult to get any of such objectors to fix a maximum price that society should pay. What is a man worth who would develop a sure cure for cancer ? It is true that society has often been very niggardly in rewarding those who have been among its great benefactors, but in general we pay for what we get and a severely restrictive policy in the matter of rewarding scientific and industrial leaders might retard rather than advance on progress.
Large Majority Vote Favors Summer Prom
1,500Attend First Summer Drama Series By Robert J. Deckard Three “sizzzling” Playshop playlets went off with a “bang” last night before 1,500 spectators in the north end of Ross-Ade Stadium in the first session of summer dramas. With a half-moon adding to the brilliancy of the thirty-minute productions, the crowd “hee-hawed” and grinned at the antics of the characters for an hour and a half. Cast for the first performance, introduced by Kenn Carmichael, University director of dramatics, included Ira French, Mary Elizabeth Yeager, Mary Blocker, and Harold Martin, making appearances in “The First Dress Suit*” The story depicted the vicissitudes of a boy who had obtained his first evening clothes. Grid Star Makes Debut Tony Ippolito, Boilermaker football star, made his dramatic debut in “The Dear Departed,” the story of a man who pretended to die in order to find out what his relatives thought of him. He was supported by Phyllis Umfreys, Sara Alice McIntosh, Paul Humphrey, Jayne Myer, and Joe Martin. The last of the trio of dramatizations was one of George Ade’s wellknown plays, “The Mayor and the Manicure.” The play concerned the adventures of Willie Milford (Alfred Exton), son of the Honorable Otis Milford (Robert Schlendorf), with Genevieve Le Clair as the manicurist, to whom he had written damaging love letters while away at college. The manicurist takes the letters to Willie’s father in an attempt at blackmail. Ruth Poster, Willie’s fiance, portrayed by Thais Crepps, enters the scene as the third party of the love triangle. Tryouts For Second Plays Program Are Saturday Afternoon Tryouts for the-second series of Summer Session plays are scheduled for Saturday afternoon aife 2 o’clock. Dramatics Director H. Kenn Carmichael annouAceid last night. Students may report at the north door of Eliza Fowler Hall ‘ then for hearings. The plays — “Monkey’s Paw,” “Trysting Place,” and “At the Stroke of Nine”—^will be given August 3. Students Ernestine Brown, Betty Ann Florer, Helen Hayes, Nota Misner, Flo Caldwell, and Sam Marks will direct the production, with Carmichael’s assistance. Clinic Speaker Dies Warren J. Young, superintendent of Bedford schools, who was scheduled to appear on the Educational Leaders’ Clinic program at the University next we^, died Tuesday at an Indianapolia hospital.
Publication Dates Exponent will publish Summer Session issues on following dates: July 14, 21, and 28; and August 4 and 11.

Committee Acts Today On Details For Formal' Dance Summer Prom possibilities became probabilities over the week-end as students and staff members voted overwhelmingly in favor of staging the University’s first formal dance of this kind on Friday night, July 29. Of 138 ballots submitted in the Exponent-Union poll, 132 answered affirmatively the question “Do you want a Summer Prom?” Only six voters disagreed with the idea. Lay Plans Today Results of this voting met favorable attention in Prof. O. F. Hall's social committee yesterday noon, and the matter was referred to the mixer subcommittee, chairmaned by Union Manager L. M. Vallely, for working out of details. Vallely’s group will discuss Prom plans in his office at 4 o’clock this afternoon. Concerning July 29 as the proposed date for Prom, 120 persons said this night was suitable to them, while 15 indicated preferences for other times. Seven voters checked July 22, seven marked August 5, and one marked July 30 as more satisfactory nights. Hours of 10 p.m. to 3 a.m. topped the choices for duration of the dance, with 56 votes. Second place went to 9 to 2, with 42 markers. Twenty-three students voted for 10 to 2, 11 for 9 to 1, three for 10 to 4, and one for 9 to 3. $2 Tops List Surprisingly high to supporters of a Summer Session Prom were prices that voters said they were willing to pay to attend the dance. Sixty students checked $2 as their figure, 36 chose $2.50, 18 favored $1.50, 10 marked $1, one wrote in $5, and another youth placed his price at $50. Most strongly contested issue was the ballot item ^‘Shall we have a Prom Queen?” On this point, 65 persons voted affirmatively, while 54 disapproved the suggestion. Social committee members agreed (Continued on page 4^
Civil Camp Engineers Burn Midnight Oil Over Maps
By L. W. Smith And F. W. Miller Exponent Correspondents Ross Camp, July 6—Ross Camp students have been burning a lot of midnight oil lately in mapping the oamp araa. Students of the “topo” division are making maps of the territory covered by triangulation systems while the “location” groups are calculating highway curves, plotting them on maps, and staking them out on the ground. E. "W. Kraft, representative of Keuffel and Esser company, was a guest at Ross Gamp for a few days. SAE Company manufactures most Of the surveying and drawing instruments used in camp, and Kraft related to the fellows here many interesting points in their manufhcture and use. Joker Steals Bell Some practical joker took the Camp bell from the office eaidy last
week and suspended it from the water tower. Under threat of a test every day until it was returned, someone quickly scaled the tower and recovered the vagrant bell. A numeral ’41 painted in glaring two-foot letters, has mysteriously appeared on the water tower. It is a tradition here at Camp for each class to leave their numerals on that tower—the '40 painted on last year was visible until last Tuesday night. Everyone in Camp has conceded the watermelon eating championship to Professor Springei*, who, by the way, was heard to crack, “Engineering is a matter of dollai“s and sense.” After thi'ee weeks here a few first class beards are beginning to appear. Since Bob Kany shaved, J. 0. Freese seems to be leading the field by a safe margin with R. K. Higman and Bob Paddock several hairs behind.mmm
EDITORIAL
THE PURDUE SUMMER EXPONENT
HUMOR
Thursday, July 7, 1938
Opportunities V^asted*. .. . . . describes the first four of this summer’s convocations in the care of all too many students. Although fah'-sized crowds have attended these affairs, eds and co-eds have furnished far too small a proportion of these attendances. We dislike to preach, but we dislike even worse to see the talents and valuable ideas of prominent speakers missing what we consider their most important target — the summer student body. No effort has been spared to make these 50-minute lectures as painless and as interesting as possible. Classes are dismissed especially to allow time for them. Microphone and amplifier systems are utilized to make the speakers’ words distinctly audible to each person in the audience. As Summer Session Director Knight has said: “We have no professional lecturers scheduled for these convos; but instead we have invited distinguished scholars.” Those who have attended these first programs have appreciated that distinction. No impersonal, flowery oratory has been fed to them . , . but instead they have heard straight facts and candid opinions, voiced by men who know their subjects and are interested only in getting their subject matter across. More opportunities wili come up in future convocations. We hope fewer students waste these opportunities . . . opportunities well worth the hour which they take away from classes.

National League All-Stars Drub American Squad, 4-1 With the lads from the host city, Cincinnati, showing the way, the National League All-Stars defeated the American League team 4-1 yesterday afternoon in the best exhibition the senior circuit has put on since the games began in 1933.
JACKET-DRESS FOR SUMMER A Sheer Print, topped off by a short sleeved jacket is cool and appropriate for summer. And remember to have your wardrobe cleaned and pressed by West Side.
Johnny Vander Meer started the game, holding the American League team to one lone hit in the three innings he pitched, while Hack and Herman put together a hit and an error to give him a one run lead, enough to give him credit for the victory. But it was Lombardi, Vander Meer’s Cincinnati battery mate, who put the game on ice with a single after Mel Ott had tripled in the fourth to give the National League its second run of the day. That was all that was needed although they scored two more runs in the seventh. Lombardi was the only man on the winning team to get two hits. Cronin Doubles The only run the American League got came in the last inning with one out when DiMaggio singled and Cronin knocked the Yankee in with a 382-foot double. Only one of the senidr circuit runs was earned. The last two came in when Foxx threw wild to first with McCormack on base and Durocher, who hit the ball to Foxx, followed McCormack around the "bases as DiMaggio completed the damage with a wild throw to third.

Softball Tourney Enters Round One This Afternoon Four fraternities have returned entry blanks for the first Summer Session softball tournament, and more are expected in today. Chief Clevett said yesterday “all teams that wish to play should show up on Intramural Field Thursday afternoon at 4:15 oclock whether or not they have handed in their list of players.” Independent groups, such as rooming l^ouse or faculty teams, may also enter the tournament by appearing on the field at that time ■ this afternoon. They will be assigned opponents and playing diamonds for this first day, after which a regular schedule will be drawn up. Stick" To Your Team After an individual has appeared in the lineup of one team once he will not be permitted to change to another “even though he may be stuck with a lemon.” That’s the chief eligibility rule, Clevett stated. Harvard Teacher Appointed On University Sta^f Prof. Robert P. Siskind, of Harvard University, widely known in the field of electrical communications,, has been appointed associate professor in that subject for the University, effective Sept. 1, it was announced recently by President E. C. Elliott. He will succeed Dr. C. B. Aiken, who resigned his post to engage in consulting practice in New York. Professor Siskind, a native of Boston, was graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1922, and took his master’s degree at Harvard in 1925, after some industrial work and graduate study. In 1925 Siskind joined the Harvard faculty and has been in charge of the courses in telephony, power transmission and communication networks. Other Appointments Several other appointments recently approved were also announced as follows: R. L. Schmoyer made instructor in machine design; and D. R. Shreve, G. B. VanSchaack, and M. S. Webster appointed instructors in mathematics.
Best crack concerning yesterday’s National League victory in the AllStar classic at Cincinnati: “I must have made ’em mad!” It was Mr. Heeney, that sly New York sports writer who came through with that crack—the same Mr. Heeney who some weeks ago said the National League was just an overrated minor league. —PC— Johnny Vander Meer and Bill Lee handcuffed the American siege guns to the plate. Two hits, one a double which Lippy Durocher lost in the sun, and no runs were all the junior sluggers could garner in the first six innings. —FC— Hack and Herman, of the Cubs, and Medwick, of the Cards, turned in fine fielding games for the Nationals while Foxx (playing third after the fourth so that Gehrig could maintain his consecutive game record) and DiMaggio,.trying to see who could throw the farthest, tossed a couple of tallies to the Terry clan. —FC— The time has now come when all loyal students, alumni, and townspeople should take- out a pencil, look in last year’s football rosters; and then place an “X” by the names of their favorite gridiron stars who finished their football careers in November. —FC— The All - Star football contest, sponsored annually by the Chicago Tribune, has always been an interesting game because hot stove leaguers have not quit arguing about whether a good college team is better than a good professional team. The following Purdue players have an excellent chance of being selected on the rah-rah eleven: Powell, Zachary, Schreyer, Woltman. Grant and the Isbells (Cec and Cody). Send your votes to Arch Ward care of the Chicago Tribune sports department. —FC— Clem Woltman, star tackle on the last three Purdue teams, has signed to play pro ball with the Philadelphia Eagles. Clem’s 220 pounds should plug many a hole for them. —FC— A full house should be in order next Thursday when Gene Tunney, former heavyweight champion, speaks at the annual Summer Session banquet. Tunney is known as a good speaker and an uncommonly smart man . . . one of the very few who have had sense enough to quit the ring before being knocked into mental unconsciousness.
Today Brings Second ^Games On Green' Tonight at 6:30 the intramural department will present the second edition of “Games on the Green" on the varsity field north of the Fieldhouse. The games, which attracted a good-sized crowd last Thursday, are expected to draw more people tonight if the weather does not take a sudden turn for the worse.
Polyrhythmic Exercise Features Tomorrow*5 Gy m Demonstrations Polyrhythmic exercise, a new phase of physical education programs, will be featured in a special demonstration at the new men’s gymnasium tomorrow morning at 10 o’clock under the direction of E. W. Wilson, of Los Angeles, Cal. Wilson is an authority on this form of exercise, which is receiving wide attention at present. Included on the program, designed primarily for administrators and directors of physical education, but open to the general public, are a lecture, motion pictures, demonstrations, and an activity period. Tennis Play Continues Tennis is underway at the present time, but very few participants have played their first games. Saturday is the deadline for all games of the first round. Any game in the first round which has not been played by Saturday will be scratched off the list and the remaining men entered, each person who has won his first game, will continue into f;he second round.

Clevett, who is in charge of the program, said yesterday that if there were more persons present than the equipment available could take care of they would inaugurate a set of circle games such as “three' deep,” “la tag,” “late for breakfast,” and “poison club.” This would enable those who arrived late to enjoy the informal group gathering without having to run too much. In general, the program will run much as the first games did last week. Persons may play softball, badminton, ring tennis, croquet, tether ball, and archery, as they did then. Ross Camp, Local Swimming Teams Schedule Contest A swimming meet between Ross Camp and the Summer Session teams is being aranged for late this month. The tentative date is July 26. Chief Clevett announced that on the program will be fancy diving, 100 yard free style, 50 yard free style, 50 yard back stroke, 50 yard side stroke, and 100 yard breast stroke. A blank is now on the bulletin board across from the checkout service on which all interested may sign their names and the event which they intend to enter.

How Methods Have Changed
From the horse and buggy of yesteryear to the speedy roadster of today. Of course the old timers can still recall some of the advantages of the buggy (no steering wheel!) but there are so many more for the car of today—speed, power, beauty are just a few. And right along with the mpdern car have come modern methods— up-to-date machinery and skilled mechanics to operate it. This is something to think about when your automobile Is in need of repair. Take your buggy to the blacksmith; take your car to Anderson’s ...

«THE PURDUE SUM EXPONENT
Thursday, July 7, 1938
NEWS since Sunday
WASHINGTON Dixie’s Economic . . . ... troubles must be righted for the well-being of the entire country, the President wrote pointedly on Tuesday to a conference of government officials, businessmen, and economists from 13 southern states, called by Director Lowell Mellett of the National Emergency Council. Said the Chief Executive, “It is my conviction that the South presents right now the nation’s No. 1 economic problem—the nation’s problem, not merely the South’s, for we have an economic unbalance in the nation as a whole, due to this very condition of the South.” This council agreed yesterday to tell the President that Federal relief spending in the South is a means of renewing “springs” of prosperity in that area. Population . . . ... in the United States will reach its peak of 158,000,000 in 1988, thereafter will dwindle and consist largely of old or middle-aged people. That was Tuesday night’s report by President Roosevelt of
predictions made by his committee on population problems. “A most striking feature of the population shift predicted for the next few decades,” the committee found, “is the increase in the number of older workers relative to the number of younger adults.” Court Battle . . . . . . again is brewing. Yesterday at his press conference Roosevelt indicated that the Government Reorganization Bill is near the top of the list of issues which he intends to present to voters on his transcontinental journey beginning tomorrow, and then again to Congress at next session. This Supreme Court measure passed the House in its recent assembly, but an omnibus bill substituted by the Senate later met rejection at the hands of Representatives. Back Into The Fold . . . ... of Indiana’s Democratic party, came “Prodigal Son” Frederick VanNuys, United States Senator, this week. Reconciliation resulted Monday night when Governor M. Clifford Townsend invited VanNuys by telegram to “become a candidate’” at a “wide open convention” in Indianapolis July 12. Today Senator VanNuys is the leading, perhaps only, candidate for senatorial nomination on the state Democratic ticket.
NATIONAL This July 4th . . . . . . may or may not have inspired more deaths and accidents than any of its predecessors. Conflicting press reports place the fatality figure at 517 or 576, the former being better than usual, and the latter surpassing last year’s accepted flgure by 16. Uncontested, however, was the title of greatest destroyer won easily by the automobile which snuffed out about 270 lives. Fireworks impaired the safety and sanity of this year’s gala holiday week-end with only a mere three deaths. Nebraska and Nevada were the only states whose morgues got no business from violence or accidents over the Fourth. Lazy Indiana Streams . . . . . . fed by torrential two-day rains last week deluged thousands of acres of low land, flooded wheat, corn, and tomato fields to cut this year’s expected farm incomes by hundreds of thousands of dollars. No accurate estimate of the damage has yet been made, but near the river and stream beds crop losses will be almost total. Roosevelt . . . ... in his “Gettysburg address” Sunday dedicated a monument to American “peace eternal,” and told the assembled throng of 150,000 how the country is “near to winning

another struggle as fundamental as that waged by Lincoln.” Where 76 years ago the blue and gray met on the Gettysburg fields in battle, a scant 2,000 survivors of these ranks convened there for the last time last week-end. Members of the huge civilian army filled the ranks of the 150,000 that heard Roosevelt. FOREIGN Suzanne Lenglen . . . . . . one of the greatest women tennis players in the game’s history, died Monday in Paris. Suzanne was French champion seven times and British titl^holder six times. She died at the age of 39 from pernicious anemia. Five Million . . . . . . dollars and a two-year-old son separate Countess Barbara Hutton, Woolworth heiress, and her husband. Count Haugwitz-Re-ventlow, from peaceful settlement of their martial dispute. That’s the price the five-cent heiress must pay for a divorce, so says the count. Hearings in London’s Bow-Street Court were adjourned until July 13, when a jury will decide whether the count really “meant to bodily harm Barbara.” Austrians . . . . . . numbering more than four million will flee their homes if the 32-nation conference, which, opened in Paris yesterday, can And them homes, American delegates were told. The Conference is assembling to help solve racial problems which now exist in many qf the harrassed European countries. Myron C. Taylor, former head of the United States Steel Corporation, leads the American delegation. France is considering making the ex-steel magnate chairman of the conference. Summer School Co-eds Arrange Cabin Picnic All women Summer Session students are invited to attend a picnic at the WAA cabin next Wednesday evening at 6 o’clock. Chairman Louise Banta announced that tickets can be obtained at the WRH office, the Memorial Gym, and the Union desk. Transportation will be provided for those who have no other means, if they meet at the Memorial Gym at 5:30 p. m. Refreshments and games are planned for all.

with general student opinion in yesterday’s luncheon session, but decided hours of 10 to 2 would work out more satisfactorily as, Prom dancing hours. Saturday classes and warm weather influenced this sentiment. Select Queen On Prom Night After dissenting discussion. Professor Hall’s group voted favorably on the Prom Queen subject. Motion was carried to select the queen on Prom night from a previously nominated list of Summer Session coeds. Each dancer would indicate a choice upon entering the Union ballroom, and the queen would be announced after tabulation of votes. Members of the mixer subcommittee are Chairman Vallely, Dr. Floyd Eastwood, and Miss Ruth Houghton, of the University staff, and Students Ted Cabonargi, Fred Hartman, Sully Mason, Dick Meissner, Margaret Mitchell, Burton Morgan, Janet Pickering, and Paul Worcester. “Use Money For Orchestra” Representative of Prom suggestions set down by voters in the poll was one sent in by campus mail from the home economics department. It read: “Formal dress . . . good orchestra with plenty of good novelty acts ... no decorations — use money for orchestra.” Then followed the note, “This is a voice from the Home Ec staff speaking for them as a whole.” One sarcastic dissenter with the Prom proposal answered the first two items negatively, and scribbled at the bottom of his ballot, “Forget the whole thing.” Not counted in the tabulations were 112 ballots filled out alike by a couple of loiterers at the main Union desk and dropped into Exponent’s box there.
Graduate Students: Students now registered in the Summer Session who have a bachelor’s degree from a recognized institution with a four year undergraduate curriculum are eligible for admission to the Graduate School. All those who expect, now or later, to become candidates for an advanced degree and receive graduate credit in courses for which they are now registered should apply for admission to the Graduate School. Graduates of other Institutions than Purdue University should submit to me a transcript of their undergraduate credits. Blanks on which formal application for admission is made can be obtained at my office in room 106, Purdue Hall, or at the Eegistrar’s office. —DUKES.
