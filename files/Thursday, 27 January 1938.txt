University Staff Member Dies Of Rare Malady
Otto G. Johanningsmeier, associate in the farm management department of the University agricultural extension division, died in the Home Hospital 'Tuesday afternoon from a strange form of malady. He was 39 and has been confined to his home by this illness since the middle of October.
Case Unusual His case, which had attracted wide attention, involved a malignant sinus growth. It was unusual because of the nature and location of the affliction. While in Chicago several years ago for a series of treatments, he received the second largest dose of radium ever administered to a human being. Following his graduation from the school of agriculture in 1925,_he spent one year as teacher of vocational agriculture at Edwardsport. Johanningsmeier returned to the University the following year for graduate work and after receiving his master’s degree in 1928, he joined the farm management staff. Leaves Wife, Children f Surviving him are his widow, Bertha Eilering Johanningsmeier, formerly of Indianapolis, to whom hp was married in 1929; two sons, Arthur George and Virgil Dale; his mother;, three brothers; and two sisters.

$300,000 Exhibit Attracts 3,000 Visitors To Armory
By R. E. Insley
So that the some 875 delegates to the 24th annual road school and the general public may see for themselves that all this revolutionary progress in the road building field isn’t merely the text of a talk, the Indiana Highway Materials and Equipment Association has assembled a representative exhibit of road and highway machinery under the .caption of “Road Show.” Free Show ' This production, unlike its competitors for the public’s attention is absolutely free—^the price of admission being the effort expended by the visitor in opening the huge Armory door. Although the $300,000 panorama of modern construction methods is in its second and final day today it has been estimated that
some 3,000 persons have viewed the exhibits.
Excavator an Attraction Probably the greatest feature atti'action in the show is the creamcolored excavator mounted on the cream-colored flat bed truck. Ease of placement and transportation aj-e the biggest assets to this engineering novelty. Besides offering accessibility to both the sides and back of the unit, the shovel is capable of dumping in the driver’s seat or mashing in the hood of the truck with the bucket. Several movies in different exhibits, a model gi'ade crossing, and a special demonstration by an allpneumatic operated I'oad grader topped the show’s activities for the day.
Dr. Hatt Outlines Results Of Road Research Project
Results and fundamental information concerning the Pur-due-State Highway Commission road research project, which is being conducted here, were outlined yesterday at the 24th annual road school by Dr. W. K. Hatt, former head of the school of civil engineering. The program was undertaken almost two years ago in cooperation with the Highway Commission for the purpose of securing information which would lead to building better roads for the same expenditure. Construction of a sample strip
of road two miles northwest of the campus to study climatic effects and also the sampling of paving materials in various parts of the state, was described by Dr. Hatt. The road research was recently given impetus by an appropriation of $50,000 at the last session of the Indiana Legislature. Get Most From Money “Since the state is spending about twenty million dollars a year and the counties around ten million more in highway work, it is especially important that we know definitely that we are getting the most for our money,” said Dr. Hatt. In 1936, over 3,000 miles of surface treatments were inspected and more than 200 samples from these surface treatments were collected for laboratory analysis, Hatt explained. Coordination of Weather, Wear “This survey showed that there is a definiite relation between tMfe time of construction, weather conditions and service behavior of these surface treatments,” said Dr. Hatt. “In general, those surface treatments completed earlier in the season during favorable weather, and those having a higher bitumen content were able to better resist raveling. On the program with Dr. Hatt were Prof. R. A. Moyer, of Iowa State College, who spoke on development of non-skid road surfaces, and Earl Feldipan, engineer of tests for the highway commission.

Students May Soon Study Labor...
... problems from ringside seats, if the present union troubles of Yale and Harvard spread into other of our educational institutions. Perhaps some of the colleges and universities will be forced to uphold practically the labor standards they advocate in their economics courses. Harvard is trying to reach an agreement with the American Federation of Labor concerning wages and hours of its kitchen workers, scrubmen, and maids. Some j^ears ago the university evaded the situation of underpaying its scrubwomen by hiring scrubmen at low wages; now the AF of L has begun to organize these and other workers at the Cambridge, Mass., university. But it’s at Yale that the biggest labor row is stirring. Nation’s Writer George Butler, a graduate of the Eli institution, presents an interesting picture of unionism’s attempted matriculation into college in the article “Yale Needs the CIO,” in the January 15 issue of his magazine. One of Yale’s professors, it seems, became interested in the labor standards of his university a few years ago and decided to look into the situation. But the dictatorial influence of Yale’s administration—a factor which permits universities to avoid many unpleasant attacks—turned his energies into other fields ... it remained for an unhampered researcher to bring the facts to light. This investigator revealed that Connecticut’s prosperous Yale pays maids at the rate of 25 cents an hour, while Connecticut’s sweatshop laundry industry pays a median wage of 29.1 cents per hour; that Yale pays a night watchman less than these same laundries pay their male workers; that non-professional workers at New Haven Hospital, which receives $50,000 annually from Yale for “its close relationship to the medical and nursing schools,” receive scarely a health and. decency wage. Yale’s depression economy program did not alter salaries of deans and professors in the $10,000 class, but it cut wages of low-paid janitorial, library, and, other workers 5 and 10 per cent, and laid some of them off, to trim its $8,000,000-a-year budget by the trifling sum of $28,000. The “front” of the university did not suffer from the depression measures, however, and after all that’s the essential thing in any educational institution. David McCalmont, editor-in-chief of the Yale Law Journal, wrote: The affair is probably just an April Fool false rumor for the university seems to be spending just as much money as ever on luxurious upholstery to soothe our backs, expensive wood carv-

For these noble purposes, to be sure, our janitors will be more than willing to give up the luxury of riding two or three miles to and from work on a trolley car, or the luxury of serving milk to their children. Yale officials managed to evade the issuedast year, but the Student Council appointed a committee to push the matter this year, and now the New England regional director of CIO has promised an immediate organization drive among the university’s service employees.
Letters to the Editor
Editor’s Note: Yesterday we heard a couple of students from the south campus arguing about the advantages and disadvantages of the Student’s Book Exchange and asked them to put down their respective arguments in writing. Here’s the result:
Book Exchange Will Banish Student Services Dear Editor: Is it possible that the students who conceived the idea for the Student’s Book Exchange think they are really doing the students, a service ? Can they not see that they are doing a great harm to the existing private book stores which maintain many services for the students at considerable expense to themselves ? Such services as staying open at nights to accommodate those students who can not get to the village during the day, cashing checks, the safe keeping of student money, and offering a market ’for a thousand and one things, which the students would otherwise have to purchase on the East Side, are all conveniences which we little appreciate as long as we have them. Take them away, however, and their absence presents a great hardship. None of these can possibly be offered by the Student’s Book Exchange, and yet it will make it almost impossible for the private book stores to maintain these services. The Exchange will be open for only six days; yet it can and probably will make these other services non-existing throughout the entire year. Is it worth it? I for one, can not see that they have anything to gain by participation in such an undertaking. R. E. L., Ag ’39.
The Saving Is Worth It Dear Editor; R. E. L. must either be a pessimist or have some private interests which will suffer from the success of the Student’s Book Exchange, I should think that anyone, after a
little thought on the matter, could readily see that the Exchange is one of the biggest and most farreaching student enterprise ever attempted at Purdue. It means money in the pocketbook of every student. It can easily be seen that about $15 is the average expenditure per student per semester for books. That means $90,000 is paid out by the 6,000 Purdue students twice annually. Now the Student’s Book Exchange makes it possible for 40 per cent to stay in student hands, 20 per cent to the person selling the books and 20 per cent to the person buying the books—^or $36,000 remaining in student hands which would otherwise be spent on books. That is a saving of $6 per student per semester. We are still faced with the fact that not all books will be available through the Book Exchange; so, let’s drop the saving to $4 per student or $24,000 for the entire student body. The figures used are necessarily estimates of the average expenditure per student and the percentalge of books that will be available through the Book Exchange, but I think that they are both low enough so as not to exaggerate the possible student saving. As for the services which R. E. L. considered so valuable, these services are carried on by the private book stores as advertising features to increase the sale of the “thousand and one things” on their shelves. None of the services which he mentioned is one which can not be obtained elsewhere in the. Village, except perhaps staying open nights. Is it worth $4 a semester to you to see the lights burning in the buildings in the Village every night until ten o’clock ? I think that “we’ve got something there,” and I hope that every other student gives the Student’s Book Exchange the same support and cooperation I am going to. R. L. B., Ag ’39.
What, Where, When?
My gawd, wot a ded hole this is! Finals, finals!! ' Last nite only 5 Purdue guys and gals were in the Blaze, 7 in GC, and 6 in Sheep Corral. At this point, your correspondent cudn’t see to. count the rest. The crap table oper ators say it’s their dullest season in many a week. While we were on our little vice tour, we saw Flash Light of the Sig house in the GC. He is very much in love with their singer. Dear Dave, , What has she got that I haven’t got? Yours, , A certain co-ed. “Why are Bill’s eyes like a sparrow?” “I’ll bite.” “They’re alw'ays flitting about from limb to limb.” For republicans and big business only^—It seems a young couple were going to have their baby christened. When the clergyman inquired the child’s name, the husband, after a moment’s hesitation, replied, “Franklin Delano.” ' Immediately afterwards, with anger in her eye, the wife demanded to know why he had veered from their predetermined choice of “Egbert.”
Elevator etiquette should really be no different from any other public etiquette. One can talk too loud very easily in that small room of the car; pushing from the back is universal; and shoving is almo.st unavoidable. Someone has to be in the back of
the car, and it might as well beyou today as tomorrow. Everyone in the back has to get out, so here is an important opportunity for good manners. Don’t push and shove to get out. Call your floor a stop ahead and after the car has stopped say if necessary: “May I get out, please?” or, “Excuse me, please.” You’ll get out all right. ■ Men should remove their hats in an elevator, if it is a closed, semiprivate room. It is a marked courtesy to thank the elevator operator for taking you up or down, particularly if you are the only one or one of a few occupants. Don’t as we have suggested, talk too loud. One can hear all kinds of funny things in an elevator. Be careful to wait until the car . has come to a complete stop before trying to step out. Don’t push or shove unless really unavoidable. And when you know the car is going to fill up, step back to the back of the car and face the front, not sidewise to talk with your friend; the conversation can wait until you get out of the car.

THE PURDUE EXPOHEHT
Bucket T^am To Meet lU, mini To Begin Semester
Purdue students will have a weekend of basketball when they come back to school to begin the second semester as t’Ovo of the Boilermaker’s most deadly rivals, Indiana and Illinois, journey here to meet Purdue on February 5 and 7 respectively.
Although Indiana, tied with Ohio State for sixth place in the Western Conference standings, and Illinois in, eighth place, are both down in the conference race, both games have been sold out completely for
days.
Crimson Squad Tough The Crimson squad from Bloomington is Purdue’s foremost rival in every sport, and, although they do not seem to have, packed much power in their games so far this year, now is .fhe time when the Boil-ermak-ers must be wary. Indiana, always plenty tough in basketball, has a record of two wins and three losses. Andres is just five points behind Jewell Young in the Big Ten individual scoring race with 55 tallies.
Illinois fans are intending to send a huge aggregation of followers here by special train for the game on Monday night. The Illini squad will bring jovial Pick Dehner, leader of the Western Conference scoring competition with 97 points. He has played in six games. The Purdue squad will be trying to hold the giant Illini center to very few tallies in the scoring column in order that Jewell Young will have his chance to catch up with Dehner in the scoring race.
Weak Off Home Floor
The mini’s best showing of the year came when they downed the invading Boilermakers earlier in the year. In their other games, however, the Illini have been unimpressive, especially away from their home floor where they scored both of their wins against Purdue and Chicago. In the Chicago game, Pick Dehner scored 29 points to tie the all-time conference record for points scored in a single game.
Banaski Pins Opponent In Bout At Fieldhouse
Joe Banaski, Albany, N. Y., 193 pounds, pinned Stacy Hall, Columbus, 0., 170 pounds, after 27 minutes of wrestling before several hundred road men in the Fieldhouse Tuesday night. Claude Reeck, University wrestling ^oach, was referee, Merton L. Clevett, intramural chief, explained a demonstration of badminton game to the road men. A tour of the Fieldhouse, under T. R. Johnston, was also taken by many
of the road men.

Something that we don’t like at all is the way that several of the “6ig time” newspapers pick up items from various college campuses, and spread them all over their front pages in the form of dirt and sensational journalism . . . These stories really give black eyes to American college life. —fc— The stories about the “bubble bath” supplement of the Northwestern Purple Parrott which appeared in most of the Chicago newspapers last week were twisted and inaccurate accounts meant to give the readers of the papers an interesting sidelight on college life . . . And the Purple Parrot’s staff’s justifiied blasting of these newspapers did our heart good as we read of it . . . In our mind there is nothing so low as twisting stories and playing up gossip which injures someone by “Yellow dog sheets” for the mere purpose of gaining circulation .. . —fc— And these newspapers are the first to pounce on a little skirmish between rival teams or a little exhibition of bad sportsmanship when a crowd of fans loses its head over some bit of bad officiating or a little roughing up by the opposing team, and play it up like a Spanish rebellion story . . . This can’t help anyone ... We sure would like to see these papers boycotted or punished some way for their exhibition of bad journalism. .—fc— Sigma Delta Chi’s of Illinois are sponsoring a ‘good-will train’ which will bring 250 loyal Illini fans here for the Eurdue-Illinois game February 7 . . . This gives Ifurdue stu-
WAA To Discuss Coming Adivifies At Meeting
WAA will hold a mass meeting Friday, February 4, at 4 o’clock, in the Women’s Gyhi in order to give the women students on the campus an idea of sports activities in view for the coming semester. Definite plans for the general meeting will be worked out at the WAA council meeting next week. Mary Ellen Delaplane, WAA president, urges girls of all classes to attend the meeting, as these sports concern all Purdue co-eds, whether members of WAA or not.
Braddock, Farr Fight’ At Mars
Round-by-round movies of the Braddock-Farr heav3rweight bout that ran 10 rounds last Friday night in Madison Square Garden have been secured by the management of the Mars theater for showing today through Saturday. Lafayette is one of the few cities of its size to get the motion pictures on initial release.
dents and fans a good opportunity d;o show Illinois fans and players that Purdue sportsmanship isn’t so foul after all. —^fc^— Pick Dehner, Illinois’ good natured center, will be coming here far ahead of'^Jewell Young in the Big Ten scoring race . . . Although Dehner has a 37 point lead over Young, he has only a one-point advantage in his average per game . . Dehner’s 97 points come from six conference games, while Young has scored 60 points in four games . . . We definitely believe that Jewell has better than an even chance to beat out the Illini ace in the Western cojuference individual scoring competition.
