Prom Permits Number 1,070; Finish Today Prom permits distributed reached a total of over 1070 before the closing at 5 o’clock yesterday afternoon. Distribution of permits will continue today in room D of the Union Building from 4 to 5:30 p. m. This will be the last opportunity to obtain a permit for the Junior Prom, stressed Committee member Bob Ruth. Because of the large number of permits already distributed, some limit will have to be placed on the number of tickets, said Bob Sasser, Prom chairman. Those who pay the $4 for the ticket to Cashier Hollensbe at the Executive Building first, will be given precedence in obtaining tickets, Sasser added. A complimentary ticket will be given to the person who submits the best detailed plan for dance decorations, Sully Mason, committee member in charge, announced yesterday. The plans must be submitted by tomorrow to him with a cost estimate, which may not exceed $200, he added.

Lightning Carves Jagged Crack On Purdue Stack In Mad Rush To Earth
By F. J. Harmon The famous Purdue smokestack, distinctive feature to all visitors to the University, was also the object of attention of another sort from the elements. One dark night a week or so ago, a stroke of lightning, hunting distractedly for a place to land, spied the 260-foot cylindrical brick stack, and in its hurry to reach the ground, zigzagged its way for 15 feet down the outside of the structure, leaving a crack about five inches deep as evidence of its passage. Strikes Cable If its aim was destruction of the chimney, it failed, for the big smokestack is 10 to 12 inches thick at the top, and was not weakened at all by the shock. The stack is well equipped with lightning rods but they didn’t help much. According to Professor G. C. King of the mechanical engineering department, the lightning apparently struck a cable leading to one of the lightning rod points, severed it, finally reaching one of the rod grounds, and passed harmlessly to the earth. Careful observers will be able to see part of the cable dangling from near the top of the stack. The company holding the insurance of the stack has the responsibility of repairing the damage. When this will be done could not be ascertained. Few Bricks Misplaced Professor King stated last night that the job of repairing the chimney will not be difficult, as only comparatively few bricks were misplaced. There is a ladder on the inside of the stack, with inspection doors placed every 16 feet. The stack ,along with the power plant, was constructed in 1923 to replace obsolete power equipment. Construction cost for the plant was $25,000, and it was designed here at the University under the direction of Dean A. A. Potter, head of (Continued on page 2)
SDX Takes Seven Men Info Society Seven men were initiated into Sigma Delta Chi, national journalistic fraternity, Sunday night in the Union Building. A banquet in the peasant room followed the initiation, which took place in rooms 1 and 2. Prof. Charles Murphy spoke to the journalists of his experiences while working as a reporter on the Indianapolis News and the Chicago Tribune. Prof, J. H. McKee, faculty advisor, also addressed the group. Included in a fast-moving series of short informal speeches were T. R. Johnston, University publicity director; Herbert Heimlich, city editor of the Lafayette JournalCourier; Chester Allen, local photographer; Earl Butz, former Exponent editor-in-chief, and now on the farm management staff; and Glenn Sample, assistant to T. R. Johnston. New members are: Debris Edi-tor-in-Chief C. D. Ehinger, Engineer Editor-in-Chief D. D. Baals; and Exponent Associate Editors D. R. Vance, L. S. Hardin, C. D. Schroeder, D. A. Bailey, and H. I. Stanback. Teaching Positions Still Open, Says George Davis According to George E. Davis, director of the teacher placement office, vacancies in teaching positions are being reported in increasing numbers every day. All students desiring services of the teacher placement office will be required to fill out registration blanks. The forms will be available for distribution beginning March 17 at the teacher placement office, located on the fourth floor of the Executive Building.
Robertson To Talk Four Students Make 6.5
Average For Semester
At Senior Lecture Charles H. Robertson, Lafayette attorney, will speak on “Some Legal Aspects of Special Interest,” at the final marital lecture today in ifface of Dr. Elizabeth Straus of Chicago, it was announced last night by Dorothy Martenet, WSGA chairman in charge of marital lectures. Dr. Straus, who was to have spoken on “Marriage from the Viewpoint of a Woman Physician,” cancelled her engagement here because of illness. The lecture will be held in the lecture room of the Education Building at 4 p. m., and will be open to both men and wom-
en.
Mr. Robertson received his LLD degree from Cumberland University in Nashville, Tenn., later passing his bar examinations and entering into practice in Nashville. In his talk, he will discuss the legal requisites for entering into the marriage contract, and also discuss the special properties that distinguish marriage from other civil contracts. He will also discuss divorces as opposed to annulments, and list the grounds necessary, describing the need for uniform laws to govern divorces. Speaking on the technical side, he will give examples of joint property ownership and its effect on law suits. J. R. Myrriy/09,Di@s After Long Illness James R. Murray, CE ’09, died here in the St. Elizabeth Hospital yesterday after an illness of 18 weeks, the last seven of which he was confined to his bed. Mr. Murray came here in November for an operation to remove a growth from the outlet of his stomach and was given temporary relief, but never really recovered.
Four hundred and thirty students were rated distinguished for achieving a 5.00 or better scholastic index last semester, according to a list of these students released from President E. C. Elliott’s office yesterday. j Class distribution of the list shows 103 freshmen, 120 sophomores, 116 juniors, and 91 seniors. Iffie combined total exceeds the 403 of the previous sem^sterjay 27 names, and surpasses the figure of a year ago, 368, by 62 names.
Four Perfect Ratings
Four men received a perfect 6.5 rating, one more than in the previous two semesters. The top scholars are: Robert Munro, Sci ’40; Don S. Martin, ChE ’39; Lester Finklestein, EE ,’39; and Joseph L.
Waling, CE ’38.
Using the official registration figure for last semester of 6,176 persons, mathematical calculation shows that 6.96 per cent of the student body made distinguished, and also that one person in every 14.36 achieved this rating.
17 Above 6.00
The number of distinguished students by schools is: engineering (freshmen), 68; agriculture, 50; chemical engineering, 56; electrical engineering, 46; civil engineering, 12; mechanical engineering, 75; science, 69; home economics, 30; pharmacy, 16; engineering law, 1; public service engineering, 6; and phyical education, 1. Out of the 430 distinguished students, and aside from the 6.5 men, 17 students were above the 6.00 mark. A complete listing of distinguished students by classes and by schools appears elsewhere in this issue. Thefa Xi... . . . social fraternity announces the pledging of K. 0. Cartwright, of Anderson.

Scribe Interviews Woman Graduate In Animal Husbandry Short Course
Bj Joy Johnson
“I believe you’re the second woman I’ve talked to since I’ve been here,” said Jane Wilcoxson Stuck (Mrs. Goodlow Stuck) who graduated Friday, the second in her class and the only woman taking a short course in An-
imal Husbandry.
A tall, slender woman with dark hair and eyes accentuated by a fair skin, Mrs. Stuck looks more like the type of woman who would turn her energies to working in an artistic field than to animal husbandry. In fact, Mrs. Stuck had planned ' '
as a high school girl in Chicago, her birthplace, to go into the theatre and in preparation for it she studied in Paris. For several years she worked in the Goodman Theatre in Chicago and then decided to give it all up and help her father on their 1,900 acre farm in El-
dred. 111.
Visits Farm It all started when Mrs. Stuck vent down to the farm for a two weeks’ stay and thought that she couldn’t bear the farm for that long. However, she found that there was a great deal to interest her and before she left she made up her mind to take a short com’se at Purdue and learn all about cattle and swine breeding and production. “I am naturally lazy and thought that I w’ould only do enough work to get through,” she confessed, “but when I went to classes the fellows all looked at me as if ‘what’s she doing here?’ so I made up my mind to show them.” “Now that I’m through, I shall help my father run the fai'm,” she said. “It will be a hard job because there is a great prejudice against city farmers.” Does Not Like Sheep Mrs. Stuck enjoyed the intensive work that her courses demanded. However, she is not very fond of sheep judging. “They are awfully greasy animals,” she said. “There’s nothing romantic about sheep. I’m glad that we don’t have any on the
farm.”
Mrs. Stuck met her husband in summer theatre work in the Berkshires. Most of the year she spends in New York with him, but the remainder she spends at the farm where she will have ample opportunity to practice all the things she has learned in her animal husbandry courses.

Letters to the Editor
A University of Michigan professor, Dr. Joseph E. Maddy, teaches what is probably the largest class today: his class roll totals approximately 200,000. The teaching is, of course, done through radio. During the lesson, the student, with an instruction book which can be pm-chased from NBC, listens as a studio orchestra runs bar by bar, through a piece in the text. The instructor gives helpful pointers, and then with an “All together!” the entire class tries the piece, c-c-c-c-c For many years scientists at Antioch College have been striving to find the answer to “Why grass is green.” As yet, they have little hope of achieving success in their lifetime. The importance of the green in grass IS that it has the mysterious power of capturing and storing energy from the sun’s rays. If the world knew the secret of grass, engines could be built to harness the sun and thus delete all scares of a world without a continuous supply of energy. c-c-c-c-c If a prize were given for the best exhibition of sportsmanship in college athletics. West Point Military Academy would probably receive it. Each year when the hockey team of the Royal Military College of Canada journeys to West Point, the 16 members of the United States team meet the 16 Canadian players. Each player then pairs off with his corresponding player on the visiting team. Until the visitor leaves the West Pointer is his inseparable host. To make up for the lack of rooters for the visiting team, the West Point corps is divided into two equal groups, one rehearsing the songs and yells of the Canadian school to pinch hit for its rooting section. When the West Point team plays in Canada, a reverse procedure is followed.
The Way Eds Dress— On Purdue Campus Dear Editor: Someone should have written an editorial on this matter long ago. We go about our work every day without feeling any kind of responsibility towards Pui-due University. We only think of ourselves while we are in school. When, and if, we ever graduate, we want to achieve gi-eat things in life and have the basis of our success—Purdue. Why don’t you feel your responsibility towards Purdue now, too, while you are at school. It can be safely stated that about half of the men on the campus today could improve their dress in some form. There are certain things that are “frowned upon” by instructors on the campus, although they do not tell about this; being well-dressed means more to them than you think. Out of Place; Out of Style Wearing sweat shirts to classes is one of the major faults that instructors find with students. Sweat shirts or tee shirts have their place —but not in the class room. Coming to class badly in need of a shave is another fault that could be easily corrected which might in some cases, if not in all cases, place you m a better standing with any instructor. It wouldn’t require much more effort to put on a tie and a coat in the morning or to spend 15 minutes to shave. You wouldn’t only be helping Purdue, although you might not realize it. “Looie” Comes To Purdue Every year around this time, certain companies send representatives to our campus to interview our graduating seniors. While walking through the campus, they undoubtedly will pass some one that would easily pass for “Looie the Rat” in any mob. It’s small matters like this that accumulate day b(y day to hurt Purdue. If we realized these things I’m sure we wouldn’t continue doing them. Let’s do our part towards building a bigger and better Purdue. J. M. S. CE ’38.
We opened our mail this afternoon and discovered the following pome . . . which isn’t so bad, nor so very good either . , . but we decided to run it.
THE CHERRY PIE QUEEN George cut down the cherry tree. We never knew just why But he made himself a champion. Because he could not tell a lie. Now, comes Mary with some cherries, '■ And she made a cherry pie She may become a champion There would be no harm to try She put it in the oven And when the pie was brown Along came the judges And Mary won the crown. IThey put the crown upon her head A fulfilment of her dream To win a bonnet just like that One must be pretty keen. How long will she wear the crown? That we do not know But just the same she won renown And . . . with a little “dough.” Now the campus boasts a champion A pie-baking queen Hail, Hail to Old Purdue And to Miss Mary Wien. —The Skipper.
Since some pretty fair poetry has been coming in lately, we’ve decided to make this week Purdue Bold and Black poetry week. We’ll give that juicy MARS Double Pass to the best piece of poetry turned in this week. Make 'em good and we might even increase the quota.
What, Where, When?
When to rise is one of the finer bits of social technique. Boys are particularly doomed to rising in social places. Only the entrance of one of his own age and position can obviate the up-jumping of an ed. For a fraternity brother or fellow, student, boys can remain politely seated, but on the entrance or introduction of any girl, woman, or older man, a boy must rise and remain standing as long as there is any girl or woman standing in the room. Girls rise not so often as boys perhaps, for they need not rise for any but and older or honored man or woman. But still they must do it, most particularly for older women — mothers, faculty wives, or housemothers. There are, of course, occasions when your friend’s mother or the housemother will suggest that you need not rise—you’ve your lap full or are playing cards—then you remain where you are, but should stop your work until Mrs. B. leaves or sits down.

By L. D. Bown In a meeting held last week, the varsity aquatic squads elected Walt Lahey and Lorenzo Armstrong to pilot the swimming and water polo teams respectively through Big Ten competition next year. Walt Lahey, Cary Hall man, hails from South Bend, where he swam for his high school and YMCA swimming teams. iRed hair and Irish name are no indices to the even temper of this distinguished student in the chemical engineering school, who has won most of his 50 yard free style events. It was in the last Big Ten meet of this season, when Purdue defeated Indiana, that Walt received the most satisfaction in winning his event. In a close race he defeated Bob Marsh of Indiana, who had been the Indiana High School Champion in the 50 yard free style event when the two swam in competition during high school days. Lorenzo Armstrong, a Pi Kappa Phi man, comes from Chicago, where he swam for the Austin High School team and held the City championship in the 220-yard free style during 1934. In addition to

Captain Kay’s varsity pistol team continued this season’s unbroken string of victories Saturday afternoon when it defeated Virginia Military Institute 1367 to 1308 in a telegraphic meet. Ten men fired for each team and the five highest scores were sent to the other school. Newhall and Foxworthy of Purdue made the highest scores for either team, scoring 285 and 273 respectively. Other men firing for the Gold and Black to complete the five highest scores were Ewing and Greiner, who scored 271 apiece, and Ferguson, who scored 267. This was the fourth victory for the Purdue pistol squad this season. The team defeated Missouri University 1372-1346, Iowa State Agricultural College, 1S84-1292, and M. I. T., 1381-1240, for the other three wins. The pistol team hks won two national championships during the last thiee years.
being the captain of the water polo team, Armstrong is also president of the Dolphin Club and one of the mainstays of the swimming team. His greatest thrill out of competitive swimming comes when he wins an event. Lorenzo plays water polo because he believes that it is the best sport on the campus. Lahey and Armstrong are forwards on the water polo team that placed third in Big Ten competition this year.

Crowned Champions In Four Events Carrying away second honors in the half mile on the indoor track, Art Bodeau was the only one of the twenty-five Riveters to journey to the Big Ten conference in wrestling, swimming, fencing, and track, who did not return empty handed. The Boilermakers went down in the face of superior odds as Michigan, Chicago, and Ohio State swept the field to be named minor sports champions of the conference. Purdue Seventh
Competing with one of the strongest fields in history, ] Michigan ran itself into its fifth consecutive indoor track championship with 32 1-3 points; Wisconsin dogging its heels to place second, as Chuck Fenske shattered the Big Ten mile record with a 4:11.1 time. Wisconsin garnered 26 points, Iowa tagged along for third with 20 1-3, and Purdue held down seventh position with 4 tallies. Grapplers Lose The grunt and groan men were unable to survive the initial round, as Michigan repeated its track performance to dethrone Illinois and carry away the ’38 wrestling crown. Indiana followed a close second. One hundred twenty-six pound Boilermaker, Berkheiser, lost by a fall to Hughes, of Chicago. Hoffman and Gossard, in the 145 and 165 pound classes, lost by decisions to Hass and Valorz of Chicago, the latter being conference champ, and in the heavyweight division Willey was pinned by Travoich of Indiana. Wildhack Out George Wildhack, diver, and onlir Purdue tank representative, was nosed out before reaching the final round of elemination as Ohio State splashed its way to victory over Michigan, 1937 defending champs, with five firsts and a total of 62 points in the swimming meet. Fencers Nab Third Chicago fencers successfully defended their title for the third consecutive year, while Purdue fencers grabbed third in the foils matches ' and chalked up no gain in the saber and epee contests. With the epee, Meier won three and lost two as Levin lost five. The saber matches brought two victories and one de,feat for Stepath and a win and four losses for Seaborg. Foils proved a different story, however, as McWilliams won three and lost two and Reynolds won two and dropped three to clinch third for Purdue.
Sportswomen To Conduct Carnival In Women^s Gym “Right this way, folks! The biggest show on earth—stupendous, colossal! More for your money than borrowed cigarettes”—so runs the familiar line of the County Fair barker—and also runs the theme of Sportswomen’s annual penny carnival to be held Friday night m the Women’s Gymnasium. As entertaining as Will Roger’s “County Fair,” its promoters say. Admission five cents, check your coat for a penny, and then drop h copper here and there for the rest of the evening. Rob the baby’s penny bank and take in the side shows; Tipsy Turvy House, Believe It or Not, String ’Em Along, and myriad others sponsored by sororities and other women’s organizations. Starting at 9 o’clock a boy and his girl may dance until 11 for 35 cents. For those who prefer to “play the field,” the price will be a nickle a dance.

DID WE HEAR SOMEONE SAY THAT The DEBRIS is not worth $5.00 to me now!
In some few cases that may be true. BUT no-one can truthfully argue that ten, fifteen, or twenty years from now he would part with his copies of the DEBRIS for any sum of money. Yearbooks appreciate in value as time rolls by until they become a last connection with four precious and joyful years—years that usually prove to be the happies in one’s life. , For that reason, if for no other, buy your DEBRIS NOW before it is too late!a-»ia«ssstte/3rat«.*
