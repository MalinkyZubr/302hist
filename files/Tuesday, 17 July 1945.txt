... yes—you WILL attract special attention, if yoii affea thie^striking checks and plaids which are the "NE PLUS ULTRA” of this year’s finer sports wear. But, surely ydia wouldn’t venture out in a really stunning combixiation which hadn’t been freshly dry del bed and pressed.
In summer time, keep your garments iu a continuous parade to the cleaners—eveiy soiled and rum-, pled garment EVERY week.
Inflation is so easy to staff arid so very difficult to stop! It starts wifN I' things like small price rises in everyday comrnodities, a few pennies here, a few pennies there. It's hardly noticeable, at first. But then the everyday cbryirnocijties get scarcer, and the prices get higher, and people are discovering that their money doesn't go as far as It used to, so they demand higher wagES, The rnore money they get, the more they will'pay for the rapidly disappearing Gomrnbdities, You see how it works? The governrnent has laid out a program for price control, but because our government is a denfippracy^ it mpst depend on individuals—ail of us! Stick by the ceiling prrces--T-don't pa black markets. Save everything you c^n — invest it in war bonds. And then, not only will prices stay where they should, but after the war, you'll have'a tidy sum to start making your dream projects materialize! Help to control infUttion . . . before inflation controls you!
