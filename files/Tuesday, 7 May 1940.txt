sigEps Win All-Campus Senoto Holds Elcctlons Today
Show; Kappas Second
Over two thousand students and faculty members and their wives last night witnessed the first showing in the Music Hall of University Club’s all-campus show. Sweepstakes winner of the four organizations represented in last night’s show was Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity with their dramatization of the troubles of Grover Whalen and the New York World’s Fair. Second prize was won by the Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority
with their skit on Hawaii. other prizes awarded at last
night’s show were cups for runnersup in sorority and fraternity tryouts, which were held last week. Kappa Alpha Theta and Delta Up-
silon received these awards. The show, which boasted the 50
piece University orchestra in the pit, began with the Kappa Hawaiian show. Beautiful singing was supplemented in this skit with a grass skirt dance by Janet Pickering. This skit was followed by a brief interlude of piano selections by Angelo
Castellani.
The next act was a humorous satire on graduation by Cary Club. Several impersonations of campus personalities and one of Paul V. McNutt, potential presidential candidate were included in this skit. Charlie Powell and Jayne Williams were on next with a song and dance
act.
Girls from WRH presented their skit wihch they called “It’s No Laughning Matter.” In this skit they depicted a typical scene in a WRH room on date night. Following this act, five young men, John Chase, John Clai’k, Gordon Griffin, Erv Underwood, and Lester Hess, gave several selections on three marimbas. The winning act, that put on by the Sig Eps, was next. They portrayed several schemes to save the Fair which was supposedly going in the red. Billy Nose’s Aquacade, a fireside chat by FDR, a conference of world dictators, and a good liazzing of the Prom Committee were good enough to win first prize and the sweepstakes trophy for the SPE’s. The skit was directed by Dan Heiple who received the trophy on behalf of his fraternity brothers. The entertainment part of the show was concluded by Benny Burns who did a take-off on President Elliott and later repeated his song hit, “Whatta Head” from “Sweqtheaids.” Paul Adams served as master of ceremonies for the entire show and Fred Goldsmith, assistant de&n of men, awarded the prizes on behalf of the University Club.

'America Must Stay Out Of War'Says Kirby Page in Talk “War is wrong, and war is ruin,” said Kii’by Page, author and social evangelist, yesterday afternoon in his speech on “Keeping Anierica Out Of War” before a group of University students. The speech was sponsored by the Purdue Re-
ligious Council.
Page asked the group to consider the four outcomes of a war involving the United States and how they would uffect the nation in the years immediately following an armistice. Debt, taxes, inflation, and unemployment. Page said, are the four inevitable outcomes of any
war.
“If we care enough for democracy we must keep this country out of war,” he said. Page suggested that mass education, to educate others in the belief of the devastation of war, was the best way to keep this country uninvolved in the present
war.
For Europe, Page predicted complete economic collapse following an armistice.

Speaks To Seniors At Baccalaureate Pointing frankly to their status as members of various problem groups. Dr. Mildred H. McAfee, president of Wellesley College, Sunday in the sixty-sixth baccalaureate address in the Music Hall told members of the Class of 1940 that “the twentieth * century tragedy is the satisfaction men are receiving, apparently, by working toward objectives which are stultifying when achieved.” Dr. McAfee, first woman to deliver a baccalam-eate address at the University, discussed the social problems which will confront graduates, stating that in the Class of 1940 were members of the group problems of youth, unemployment, marriage, “and I see a very few of you will be involved in the 'woman problem’.” Three Solutions President McAfee sited three different ways of solving social problems as they affect the individual: conscienciously keeping ignorant of the problem, using the problem as an alibi, and attacking the problem with the purpose of contributing to its solution. “I hope that you will use all three methods. I do not invite the Class of 1940 here or elsewhere to volunteer to sacrifice themselves m the attack on our common problems as citizens of a problematic world. I call upon you to fulfill your high destiny by throwing yourselves into the pursuit of aims beyond your own immediate interests.” Calling for an end to the American characteristic of being “pseudonoble,” Dr. McAfee stated that the present “realism” which discounts self-sacrifice was a result of the fact that “self sacrifice has too often been in fact seif seeking.” Kappa Delta Pi . . . education honorary, will hold its annual election of officers at tonight’s meeting in room 328 of the Union. Installation of officers will be held at the following meeting on May 14. This meeting to be held on R. B. Stewart’s estate, will be the last one this year, and will include a spring party.

'Fraternities Are A Menace To Education/ Says Student The following is a condensation of a prize-wmnihg speech by Dwight Croessmann, student at Northwestern University, Evanston, 111., which upon its initial delivery succeeded in rocking the campus at that institution. It is reprinted here from the Intercollegian, natipnal student magazine and journal of the Student Christian movement. I am a fraternity man—one of the 1200 on the Northwestern campus, one of the 85,000 in this country. Just two years ago I was proud to be a fraternity man... Today I am not. I want to tell you why I changed my mind. In 1934 the National Interfraternity council, official spokesman for all Greeks, said: “We sincerely believe that the objectives and activities of the fraternity should be in entire accord with the aims and purposes of the institutions in which it has its chapters.” What then are the “aims and purposes” of my univeisity? What should an undergraduate reasonably expect to proeme from a university education? Three things—the first is expressed in part in the Northwestern university motto: “Whatsoever things are true, think on those things;” the second is to learn to appreciate the cultural aspects of life, to cultivate a feeling for good literature, good music, good paintings and to can-y that appreciation over into our future years; the third is to learn to understand our fellow man, and to learn to live beside him in a spirit of friendship and co-operation. The fraternity has been a traitor to these ideals. First, does a fraternity encourage its members to think? On the contrary. In two and one-half years I have heard actives ask pledges the same question a thousand times: “What sort of an average are you going to have? Are you going to make your grades ?” But never once have I heard any active, including myself, ask any pledge, “What are you getting out of this course? Are you learning anything? Is it making you think?” Yes, the fraternity atmosphere is conducive to anything but thinking. Term papers are copied, accounting practice sets are copied, problems in business organization and statistics are copied. Old examinations are filed to facilitate cramming for finals. The inevitable results are that our thinking apparatus rots; we get soft intellectually. The fraternities are missing a great opportunity when they fail to band together to bring worthwhile educational programs to this campus. But it is not important to a fraternity that its members appreciate Bach or Raphael or Emerson. The big questions are, “How many men do you have in this year’s Waa-Mu show ? How many star athletes do you have ? Do you have the co-chairman of the junior prom, the editor of the Daily, the business manager of the Syllabus?” These are the things that really matter. * * * Does a fraternity encourage its members to learn to understand and to get along with other people? In a way, yes. Forty men cannot live together for four years without recognition of the personalities and rights of other people. However, recognition of obligation toward any group terminates when the fraternity man steps outside his house door. The feeling of superiority over men of other fraternities is nothing compared to the frat man’s air of dominance over the lowly independent. An inde-

By Mary Catherine Kern NO BIRDS SING—Leslie Edgley: Leslie Edgley in No Birds Sing has 1 ecreated the bleak waste of a midwestprn steel town and the lives of a few persons attempting to find liappmess and love. Desolation is the theme of the novel while the story is told with undertones of violence and brooding melancholy. He tells of a situation which is the result of the whole economic and social order. The book is written with keen character analysis but the problem is left unsolved. Fights Franco In Spain The story concerns Nick, who is branded a Red because he has just returned from Spain wi^ piece of one of Franco’s shrapnel in his leg. He is sick at heart, bored and exasperated with life and comes back to a town where everything is the //same, the mills are still large impersonal workshops, the negros still hang around the same corners, the mill police still swing hard with their big clubs, and the jobless still try to better themselves. He does not want to stay in the town but accidentally meets a girl, Elena, and they fall in love. She lives beyond the tracks in a Lithuanian settlement where every one is dominated by old-age customs. Her father is a drunkard who holds great authority over his family and compels her to do many things that are not to her choosing. She has little courage and submits easily. Leslie Edgley was born in England and has held many positions in this country. At the present time he is a Chicago radio writer and this is his first published book.

pendent just does not belong. He had his chance didn’t he? He was “rushed.” Perhaps he came from Fort Wayne, Ind. He wanted to join a fraternity—he had read all about them in the rushing booklets. He stayed at the Beta house during rush week. The Phi Psis, Sigma Chis and Delts, along with the Betas, looked him over. Each saw him for an afternoon and an evening, talked with him for half an hour, and brought his name up in chapter meeting. Grades? Second quarter of his class. Activities? Manager of the track team at North Side high school. Appearance? Not too prepossessing. General consensus: “Seems like a nice kid-'but doesn’t have too much on the ball. Cross him off.” H: * + The Beta rushing chairman tells him he has to move out of the house. The kid tries to take it but his chin quivers. He does not have what it takes to make a fraternity—something is wrong with him. He is licked before he starts. Once the freshman takes up his residence in the Independent House he has one chance in 1,000 to be elected to a class commission or to become editor of the Daily. The fraternities have their rivalries—^but let an independent attempt to encroach on their “rightful” domain of manipulating campus activities and all the frats will band together in an unholy alliance for self-preservation. Now what kind of men does this system produce? The fraternity man—typed for the most part when he graduates—is a conformist, an intellectual deadbeat, anti-social and anti-democratic. And the Independent—many .of him—^ivill carry to the end of his days the disappointment of the fact that he “didn’t measure up.” H “k '1* A number of fraternity men have read this speech in manuscript and almost to a man they have exclaimed: “Dwight, you don’t really believe this, do you?” This question exemplifies perfectly the attitude which I have been condemning. I do not believe that the abolition of fraternities will result in an educational paradise. Far from it. But not until the anti-educational and anti-democratic fraternity system is junked will the voice of the university be heard and understood. Can any fraternity man honestly say: “Because I am a fraternity man (not despite the fact) I have received something from or have contributed something worthwhile to my university?” I can’t.
... AND SPELL IT OUT/ is the way we feel about last weekend. We don’t know where to begin to hand otit orchids for one of the gayest and most historic week-ends in the history of Purdue ... or at least in the course of our brief stay here. To the many alumni returning to the campus for the first time in a number of years the new buildings and the extensive program of events scheduled for the week-end must have seemed nothing short of a spectacle. In fact, at the dedication convocation Saturday night we overheard one alumnus remark that it was “a little different than the Purdue we knew.” We’ll have to concede that the campus is “a little different” than the one he knew ten or twenty years ago. But as Paul Cooper so ably put it Friday night when he spoke on behalf of the student body, it’s something that the modern generation of Boilermakers have grown accustomed to. We will admit, however, that we are just a little inordinately proud of our new Music Hall. We’d like to add to Cooper’s speech our little exclamation, “It’s magnificent.” To the Gala Week Committee, Eth Baugh, alumni secretary. Student Union, and other organizations connected with Gala Week, we extend our congratulations and heartiest thanks for their contributions to a very gay and a very full week-end. About the only thing left out of the program was room for a little sleep! And no one was interested in that! We feel that they have set an example for other Gala Week celebrations Which will be hard to match. But just as we are sure that this has been one of the biggest week-ends at Purdue we are also sure that there will be more memorable events in the history of Purdue which will overshadow this one and add to the BOILERMAKER SERIES! —R.

C/0; AFL Fight Too Much, NLRB Tactics Wrong, Say Students
By Associated Collegiate Press Increasing attention in American colleges and universities to the subject of labor is reflected in the college press. Virtually the full spectrum of opinion is seen in college surveys on labor unionism, the National Labor Relations board, and the American Federation of Labor versus the Congress of Industrial Organizations. The surveys while evidencing sympathy witfi the general aims of labor as a group, nevertheless sounds a gloomy note over solution of AFL-CIO difficulties and over strengthening the position of
the NLRB.
Too Much Bickering A typical comment is voiced by T u 1 a n e University’s Hullabaloo, which observes, “We have never had much patience with the continual bickering of the AFL and the CIO, since they never seem to make any attempt to meet on some common ground and smooth out some of the lough spots, but are Instead always looking for the opportunity and the place to take another jab at each other.” NRLB Under Fire As to the possible fate of the New Deal’s National Labor Relations
Board, the Capital Chimes at Capital University, Columbus, Ohio, notes that “business c^n tolerate the Securities and Exchange commission and the Federal Trade commission, but the NLRB is too, too —dastardly. The best known charge that the anti-labor brigade hurls is that the board is prosecutor, judge, juiy and janitor. It hales you into court, prosecutes you, passes sentences, and then sweeps up the pieces. Labor grumbles about employes’ rights and collective bargaining.” In the long run, however, “Most of the NLRB’s trouble comes from the men on the board rather than the act itself,” the Chimes be-
lieves.

^(inL and. 90ul Br Georeann SehllHng; What with the Alpha Chi, Beta, and Alpha Chi Rho spring dances now past history, the remaining list of this year’s social events grows shorter and shorter. Only three more weeks; and then finals and vacation! For some of us, a permanent vacation is in the offing— at least from book work. But very few of the seniors are happy about the whole thing. H&H Highlight on the coming events is the appearance of handsome Glen Grey and his Casa Loma band on May 24 for the Cary Hall spring dance. Mr. Grey’s name will be about the last to add to the list of this year’s visiting name bands. Remember that list ? It sounds like the best ever, when you recall the evenings spent listening to the rhythms of Ina Ray Hutton, Vincent Lopez, Will Osborne, Joe Sanders, Tommy Dorsey, Pinky Tomlin, George Hall, Duke Ellington, Little Jack Little, Tiny Hill, and Paul Whiteman. Let’s do it all over again. H&H Even though the name Hands of the year have gone, there are still some shining events to come. For instance the Women’s Residence Hall’s Tsle of l^ay’ dance with Jack Davis and his University of Illinois band; the SAE spring formal on May 17th and the Pi Kappa Phi dinner dance on the same night; the Kappa Kappa Gamma formal on the 18th, the Airport dance of the 25th, and the Pi Phi dance on the 18th. So goes it! H&H Yes, and here we go giving the best jeers of our life to this little piece of p^per. Yet, what if we went to the engineering school of Technology in Brooklyn? We read in the school paper that the engineeiing school had been favored with the enrollment of a movie starlet named Miss Dottie Darling, who had enrolled to “get the feel of Engineering” before her next picture. Imagine having people running around the campus tiying to get the feel of engineering. - H&H Comes Friday, and the mothers will move in upon us for their annual week-end of festivities. Most of the papes of seniors will not be around probably, for nowadays a son usually finishes college and his father at the same time

Frosh Battle Varsity Nine On Stewart And Ross-Ade Fields It was a case of Rhinie against Varsity last evening on Stuart and Ross-Ade fields, for the two respective outfits^ split their forpes and indulged in practice games on both of the diamonds beneath overcast skies that had given promise to something of a different nature earlier in the day.

Mr Mwrt J. Daekard POT POURRI NUMBER ' THIRTEEN “Derby Dopes” Expo sports editor Rolfe Jenkins and editorial director Don Terrio, Chevroleted to Louisville Friday last and are back in town today aglow with tales, facts, and interesting points concerning that great horse-racing classic, the Kentucky Derby. —^fc— “It’s the silliest setup,” Rolfe told us last night. People spend six hours at the track watching horses lun for only approximately 16 minutes. “And the horses run only once every hour,” he added. —^fc— We didn’t quite understand the system of horses “carrying 126 pounds” in the Derby, so Rolfe explained that the jockeys are weighed in with all of their riding paraphanalia and, if the weight doesn’t reach the maximum of 126 pounds, lead is added to the saddle in order to reach that prescribed by Derby officials. —^fc— Smart Ball-Playing Newspaper accounts of the first game of the Purdue-Ohio State doubleheader Saturday of course mentioned the two bunts that Frank Smithson and Bud Fisher, Boilermaker diamondmen, pulled off and worked successfully, but there was a little extra sidelight that we would like to render here. ’ —^fc—; As you remember, Frank, first PUer up, laid down a bunt that was near perfect . . . The scorekeeper called it a hit . . . Then Bud came up, sucked in the third baseman with another perfect bunt, and sent Frank rambling down to second in a hurry. —^fc— Frank, seeing that the Buckeye hot-corner man was in fielding the ball, whipped on around the keystone bag and headed for third . . .
WITH MARY KAY
Another day, another scouting trip. Here I am back in the shops again seeking to find the things collegiate people tag as "the right things to be worn on the college campus". Come along and you look too.
Do you participate in the big time sports or are you just a spectator? If the latter fits you live up to the name by wearing a pair of the newer styled (some the plain pump, some v-throat and others in oxford styles) spectators at SMITH'S in black, navy or brown and white. When you go out to play wear kedettes available in various styles and color combinations. Smittie has other sport shoes in many colors with choice of styling and heels. Now is the time to buy that new pair of dress shoes for the rest of the school year and summer. You can buy any kind and size of shoe at SMITH'S. —•— In the spring a young woman's fancy turns to picnics and outdoor sports. QUEEN CITY has the very costumes needed for any occasion. If you are a tennis whiz deck yourself in a shirt, shorts and skirt combination. They are available in checked sharkskins, plaid ginghams and striped rayons. Their colors are every hue in the rainbow. For the gals who prefer slacks, they have striped shirts with plain slacks, plaid suits and many others. One thing that I loved was a little plaid cotton shantung playsuit with a hooded shirt. QUEEN CITY is selling these marvelous play clothes for $1.98, $2.98, and
$3.98. Stop in today and get yourself a play suit while the supply is fresh.
Why do we dress according to headlines, the reason: designers take the happenings from all over the world and use incidents from wars, first nights, derbys and such for the style trends of their costumes. They create them and we wear them. But yet they do turn out some fine stuff, so ail the women still depend upon the important happenings in the world to change their styles.
Who is the one nearest your heart, who is the little women who always loves you? Yourmother o f^-^ course. Is she coming down for Mother's Day? If she does show her that you love her and make her happy with a corsage from CLARK'S. Their specialty for this weekend are carnations (in every hue). If you prefer another kind try sending her ross (many varieties, gardenias, violets, or' if you really want to spurge send her one of the coveted orchids. If you are going to be one of the unlucky students, whos mother couldn't make it this year make her happy and let her know that you are thinking of her by telegraphing flowers to her. Call CLARK'S and give them your
order (early) no matter whether it is to be delivered here or telegraphed they will take care of it for you.
I sorta donated this week's column to the eds girls but here is one ad to let you know that this is just for today and I'll be hitting the shops for you next week. So 'til tfien I say to you mark time.
Let's get comfortable eds, spring is here (honest, 'cause the calendar says so). , Take off those "y h stiff collared shirts and your old four in hands and get yourself some sport shirts from GULLION'S. Get into the swim with the. new ''Hollywood Rogue'' (a yoked front with no buttons). Wear front with no buttons). Wear the rogues open or if you are self conscious abut yur manly chest, tuck in a contrasting ascot at the neck. Other styles include plain colors with saddle stitching, plaids, checks, figures and a host of stripes in broadcloths, twills, gabardine and crashes. Stop in at GULLION'S now and get yourself a sport shirt in blue, green, tan, brown, rust, or white. Don't delay fellows. —•—. I'll be seeing you.

In the meantime. Bud was being thrown out at first . . . The shortstop was watching second, so third base was wide open as a Kansas prairie. —^fc— So down Frank went for that bag. . . . The third-,baseman, seeing that Frank was legging it for third, attempted to get back to third as the first-baseman burned the sphere to that position . . . But Smithson took to the air and “belly-slid” into the bag as safe as babe in its crib. —^fc— It was a perfect play . .. Bud had sucked the infield in and out of position by laying down the bunt which went directly parallel to the foul line, Frank quickly realized the perfect setup from his standpoint, and
The Tops
The Buckeyes from Indiana’s neighbor state, Ohio, provided the Boilermakers with a chance to climb a notch in the current Big Ten baseball standings, but our local talent made use of only half of the opportunity as they spit a double header with
the Ohio Staters, here Saturday.
- ' A large Gala Week crowd saw
the Riveters off to a good start with Bob Bailey pitching brilliant ball in the afternoon's opener, to hold the mediocre Buckeyes to only three hits. The visiting Big Ten rivals then made up their mind that it was their turn, and Dombrook took the mound and did Bailey one better as he held the Riveter sluggers
to a scanty two hits. Hawkeyes Retain Lead
On other Big Ten battle fronts there was a full card of games, all played on Friday and Saturday. Out in the Corn State at Iowa City, the powerful Hawkeyes, last year’s Big Ten champs, held on to their one and a half game lead by beating the University of Chicago on successive days. Satmrday afternoon they crushed the Maroons 12 to 2, in a game which featured the slugging of Jimmy George and fine pitching by Wendell Hill and Fred Hohenhorst. It was Iowa’s sixth win in
seven starts.
Badgers Win Two Up in Madison, the Badgers made a clean sweep out of its two game series with Indiana by taking its fifth victory in eight starts as they nosed out the Hoosiers four to two. On Friday the Badgers pulled a close game out of the fire by taking a seven to six thriller. Illinois’ strong baseball team took to slugging in order to square their series with the Wolverines from Ann Arbor. After losing Friday’s game the Illini came back with a vengeance on Saturday and hopped all over the Michigan pitchers as they pounded out a ten to six victory. Held hitless until the fifth inning, the Orange and Blue finally got going in the sixth and after that it was goodbye to Michgian with the boys from Champaign settling themselves firmly into third place in the Big Ten standings. Sun Shines for Minnesota The weather man finally smiled on the previously dormant Minnesota nine who swung into action for the first time this year as they tangled with Northwestern’s ball hawks on Friday and Satm'day. After the dust of battle had settled, the Golden Gophers thought back and wished that it had rained after all. The merciless Northwestern batters started slugging from the word “go” on Friday afternoon, and did not stop murdering Minnesota pitching until the sun set on the last of Saturday’s one-sided game. Ragged Gopher fielding and effective Wildcat pitching featured the final 10
to 2 drubbing.
the two pulled off a play that won the plaudits of the crowd.
—^fc—•
Whee, Mac! Last fall we avered that Dave Rankin, captain-elect of the football team, was the tops in sartorial display on the gridiron outfit... So with malice toward none, or any, we today personally nominate the “tops” on the current baseball team for wearing clothes that are easy on the eye. Felix Mackiewicz, co-captain of the Boilermakers, wins that honor as he turned up in classes yesterday with an array of spring clothes that knocked up for a couple oT loops . . . And that one outfit was enough to convince this department. . . . Congratulations, Mac!
