2500 Here For 1st Day Of Ag Meet Delegates Hear Reed, Matthews At Opening Of 5-Day Conference Indiana agriculturists gathered on the University campus yesterday to attend the opening sessions of the annual agricultural conference. About 2,600 representatives of all ages froni over the state had registered last evening at the registration headquarters in the Union Building. Addresses, demonstrations, forums, and entertainment will comprise the intensive five day program. Between 8,000 and 9,000 are expected to participate in this year’s sessions. General Meeting T. R. Johnson, of the University publicity department, presided over the opening general meeting in Powler Hall yesterday afternoon. Dean Matthews spoke on the topic, “Farm Homes in a World of Change.” Harry J. Reed, director and dean of agriculture, was then introduced to discuss “Looking Forward—^What May We Expect?” 1941 To Be Banner Year Citing the fact that economists predict that 1941 will bring the largest volume of business ever recorded in this nation, Dean Reed urged that agriculture be prepared for coming events. “ “As a matter of practical defense,” said Dean Reed, “agriculture as a whole must be put on a sounder basis and a workable and equitable way must be found to give ■agriculture its fair share in the national income, for otherwise it will be difficult to protect the industrial economy of this country during the post-war days to come.” Early attention of conference visitors has been focused on the Indiana State Corn and Small Grains Show, where exhibits are being arranged for judging during the coming program. Hold Luncheon Following discussions this morning, home economics delegates will hold a luncheon in the south ballroom of the Union. Indiana Rural Youth meet for general sessions this morning, and for reports and discussion in the afternoon. In the evening they will (Continued from page 2)

Wisconsin Overcomes Boilermakers 48-42 In Thrilling Extra Period Battle
'War In Part Of World MeansWarForUSV Says Convo Speaker “Ask not for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for you,” concluded Dr. Henry Wise Hobson, Bishop of the Diocese of the Southern Ohio Protestant Episcopal Church, in speaking before 2,000^ students, faculty and townspeople at the January convocation for worship Sunday mom-" ing in the Hall of Music. Isolation Impossible Discussing “The Lie of Isolation,” Dr. Hobson repeatedly emphasized that all mankind is one body, in which anything affecting one person affects all others. He said that no one could isolate himself from the society in which he lived, and that anyone believing himself safe from a fate befalling others was foolish. He declared that the bell tolling for any man or nation tolls for all men and nations. Calls For Sacrifice Dr. Hobson called for America to stop limiting its aid to China, Britain, Greece and the conquered lands, and to make any sacrifices whatsoever to stop totalitarianism. While he deplored war, he declared it was preferable to the fate befallen some peoples today. Picturing the attempts to remain out of the conflict as futile and selfish, he said, “Greater love hath no man than that he lay down his life for his neighbor.” The University Choir under the direction of Albert P. Stewart presented Ivanoff’s “Praise Ye the Name of the Lord” and “Beautiful Saviour,” arranged by Christianson. Carolyn Wood, contralto, was soloist. Dr. Hobson was introduced by President Elliott, jha Exponent- Editorial Staff There has been a change in this week’s publication schedule.

Naii Victory Plans-: Germans Hope For Quick Decision; Sure Of Break In British Morale By Wallace R. Deuel The Nazis think they are going to win the war this spring. They are not sure of it, of course, and they are making all arrangements to carry on the war indefinitely in case they do not succeed in beating Britain so soon. But they think chances are in favor of their winning within the next six months. Their own position secure against defeat for much longer than six months, the Nazis think they are going to win before the war is half a year older owing to a combination of four main
elements:
First, the Nazis think that their counterblockade, executed by U-boats, surface raiders and the German air force, will choke off England’s supplies within the next few months to the point that the British will hardly be able to go on fighting, no matter how good their morale may be.
Hope To Break Morale
Second, the Nazis think that the bombing raids will do so much damage toother qbjectives, in addition to the British service of supplies, that production of war and other industries and civilian morale will be so badly stricken that England will be forced to its knees—^apart from the question of supplies. Third, the Nazis think that the United States will be either unable or unwilling—or both—to aid Great Britain on a suf-
ficient scale and soon enough to turn the tide, and that the British will become convinced of this “fact” within the next few months and will abandon
hope and capitulate.
And fourth, the Nazis think that at some stage in this progress of events the British will be so weakened by these first three developments that they will no longer be in a position to beat off German operations to land an army—or several armies—on the British Isles, which the Germans will then under-
take.
Another Deadly Weapon There is still another deadly weapon in Adolf Hitler’s arsenal of tyranny, of course—^the psychological weapon, described in an earlier article in the present series. Hitler used this weapon to divide, confuse and discourage the British for years before the war, and achieved a considerable measure of success with it. Notably, he won incalculably precious time while he armed and (Continued on page 4)

Score Deadlocked 38-38 At Final Gun; Sprowl Leads Losen Madison, Wisconsija, January 13 (Special to the Purdue Exponent)—frenzied crowd of over 13,000 persons watched a fighting, rangy Wisconsin quintet erase a ten point last half deficit to tie the score at the end of regulation play ^d then turn on an uncanny exhibition of offensive power in the overtime period to hand the defending championship Boilermaker aggregatitm Hieir second defeat of the current conference race by the decisive score of 48-42. Bud Foster’s lofty Badgers, nearly the same team that suffered a 48-45 overtime loss to the Riveters at Madison last year, came to life late in the second half after it appeared that the Boilermakers were once again safely on the victory trail to deal the Riveters’ hopes of the winning of their second title in as many years a knockout blow. The score at the end of the first 40 minutes of play was deadlocked at 88 points apiece. Five For Five The winners sniped five field goals in as many attempts in the overtime period before the Boilermakers could get under way, and Sprowl’s pair of lofty buckets in the final seconds were not enough to stem the tide of the Badger attack. Bob Alwin, substitute forward, sparked the victors to their victory by counting a trio of consecutive tallies to throw the game into a deadlock, and then add another before the extra period was a minute old. Sprowl, Blanken Potent Junior forward Frqsty .Sprowl paced the Riveters by gamering 18 points, closely followed by teammate Don Blanken with 14. Kotz, a tricky sophomore forward, led the Badger attack with 13 points. Senior center Gene Englund played a magnificent game for the Wisconsin team, covering rebounds off both backboards and adding 10 points to his team’s total at the same time. Fred Krampe, sophomore center, was the only'reserve Coach. Lambert used in the fray. Mickey Tierney, starting his first game of the year, went all the way for the Boilermakers, along with Blemker, Sprowl, and Blanken. At the start of the game the IfiVeters spotted the Badgers seven points before hitting pay dirt themselves,. They immediately scored 11 points while Wisconsin remained scoreless, holding the lead until a minute before the gun. The Rivetera led at the intermission by a 22-17 score. In the second half they raised their lead to 31-21. From this point on the boys from Madison to^ complete control of the situation.

It Takes All Kinds
... of people to make a world, they say and after reading The Dartmouth of January 11, we’re convinced. It seems that up at Dartmouth they don’t want a name band for prom because if they have a name band Paramount Studios will make a movie short of the prom. And at Paramount’s expense, too. And we’ve been howling for a band with just the faintest hint of a reputation. There are some things we just never will understand.

Propaganda?
Several people have approached members of the Exponent staff in the past few days wanting to know why we printed such out and out propaganda as the Deuel series on “Where Hitler Stands Today.” The stories reek, they say, of the stuff that was put out in the last war to excite the American public. To the latter statement we might be inclined to agree if we were old enough to appreciate what was going on in 1917. But we weren’t and we can’t make any judicious comparison. We’ll agree, however, that the stories may work as propaganda if the reader allows himself to be emotionally keyed up instead of intelligently informed. We’re in no position to separate truth from untruth in the foreign dispatches but we are inclined to have confidence in the writers for the news service to which we subscribe. However, we still reserve the right to read, analyze and separate fact from opiskm. Here again the reader must decide whether he has confidence in the individual correspondent and even then he must realize that the correspondent is working under terrific mental stress and might be inclined to let his emotions color his dispatch. These are times when everybody is suspicious of the press and the men in Washington. But one has to have confidence, and confidence, like money, has to be put someplace. We’re putting ours in the Daily News foreign correspondents.

Conduct the State Rural Entertainment Festival in the Ball of Music. Speaking in the agronomy section of the agriculture division, Lewis Withrow ,ef Romney will discuss “Experiences With Temporary Silos.’* Also- in the morning, in the poultry division, Stanley Marsden of the United States Department of Agrriculture wrill speak on “What do We Know About Feeding Turkeys ?” A geuer^ session of the agriculture division will be held in Fowler Hall in the afternoon. This Is Interesting This is to correct any misunderstanding which may have arisen over the headline printed in the Sunday edition of the Exponent concerning^ the power which will be used by-station WBAA in the future. As was stated in the story, the normal power of the station will be 6,000 watts and a greater increase in power-would be possible due to the directional antenna. The power, under the plans as arranged at present, will not exceed 6,000 watts. A correction should also be made in the year of graduation from the electrical engineering school of Charles Jackson as it was released to us by the University alumni office. He received his masters degree in electrical engineering at the University last year. l.w.r. Rural Women's Chorus Sings Tomorrow At 7:30 The rural women’s chorus, consisting of about 1,600 to 2,000 voices, will provide the program at tomorrow evening’s session of the agricultural conference in the Hall of Music. Founded by A1 Stewart, choral director of the University,^ this dkorus represents 84 counties of Indiana. The perogram which is free and open to the general public will con-
sist of selections from a singing book compiled by Stewart. Mrs. Joseph M. Regains of West Lafayette will serve as accompanist and Miss Rosemary Robinson of Lafayette, former accompanist for University musical 'organizations, will play the organ. The chorus members will hold their o^n luncheon tomorrow noon in the Union Building north ballroom. s,r. E. F. Hauser, C. Sorenson Speak At REMC Banquet Rural electrification, its benefits, costs, progress and history were discussed at a banquet last night in the Home Economics Cafeteria. The banquet was held in connection with_ the Agricultural Conference being held here this week, in an effort to bring to mind to the public the importance of rural electrification to the farmer and the importance of that commodity in farm production. E. F. Hauser, Indiana statewide REMC, Indianapolis and C. V. Sorenson, Northern Indiana Public Service Go., Hammond, were guest speakers at the banquet. Hauser told of the progress of the Rural Electrification Co-operatives in the state and their importance as one of the chief distributors of electrical utilities in rural communities. Sorenson spoke about the co-oper-ation of the larger public utilities companies and municipalities which have co-operated with the REMC in giving electricity to the farmers in this state. j.f.z. Rural Youth Banquet In Ballroom Last Night About 210 rural youth, coming from 76 of Indiana’s 92 counties, attended the annual rural youth banquet held last night in the north ballroom of the Union. President^PaS}^ Foster of Attica presided as toastmaster for the brief informal program. A girls’ trio from Lake XjflBU^sang two numbers, Frances Stacker of Attica presented a tap dance and A1 Stewart

Delta Upsilon Keglers Beat Delts For Frirternity Bowling Crown By John Adamson ' Delta Upsilon’s bowling team managed to knock the right pins down at the right times last week-end and emerged from the finals of the Union-sponsored bowling tournament on top of the twelve-week old Greek kegling pile-up. Saturday they came from behind to whip^ a slightly favored Phi Belt five, and then finished their bowling chores’^ on Sunday by thoroughly whipping a batch of unpredictable Delts. . ' Easy Time

Sunday’s final match was a rather mild affair compared With Saturday’s two semi-final tilts. The DUs jumped off to an early lead and then kept building it up to grab the first game 836-788. The second game was run off in much the same manner with the victors having little trouble in beating the Delts staggering total of 789 pins. With nothing at stake in the third affair, the losers managed to keep from being Joo embarrassed by winning and dragging their average for the day way up to 788. Because of the non-importance of the third game, none of the scores set any records. Barnes of Delta Upsilon was the high man for the afternoon with a 636, and was followed by his teammates Henderson with a 623, and Starek with 504. Jack Kendrick of the Delts then managed to sneak in with a 603. The two team series followed the same pattern with the winners rolling a 2388 and the runner-ups a 2366, slightly different than the previous day when all four teams hit over 2526. Surprising Delts On Saturday, the Delts had beaten the Beta Sigma Phis, who were supposed to have had little trouble in winning the tournament. The two teams split their first two games and then really engaged in a thrilling finale. The outcome wasn’t decided until the final frame with the Delts coming out on top of a 897- ' 891 affair. In the other match, the Delta Upsilon lads dropped the first game to the Phi Delts, and then proceeded to bash their way through the next two.

Coach Joe Benna is stepping up the pace in order to have his battlers in shape for the grueling tournament. The Riveter squad will not enter the affair until January 29 because of the final exams although it gets under way a
week earlier.
Asserting that his charges ai’e not yet in shape. Coach Benna ordered two two-minute rounds as a daily chore for the leather-pushers in addition to the regular exercises which are part of their routine. Calling All Heavyweights Joe is gravely concerned over the shortage of heavier men which prevails in his camp. At this late date there are no heavsrweights on the squad and but a duo of light heavyweights. Big John Petty, varsity fullback, may join the squad to help remedy this deficiency. Benna is contemplating sending 23 men to the fistic wars, seven of which are 160-pounders. Another popular division is the welterweight or 147 pound class. Last year the Riveter team copped two first places, and with one of these champions, John Threlfall, on this year’s squad, Benna predicts three championships for his battlers. Still Time To Enter The Golden Glove bouts, which will be held at the Lafayette Armory, offer the greatest opportunity to be found to young boxers. Every entrant who wins a fight will receive a jacket and everyone who enters gains invaluable experience. There is still time for anyone who is interested to come out for the squad, and heavier boys, especially are needed. e.c.y. \ • PiKAs Defeat ATOs With the Fieldhouse vibrating to the roar of 23 rooters and a janitor last night.

Pair of New Rules The Chicago meet will be the fir^t chance the Boilermakers will have had to try out the new rules for dual meets in which the low hurdjles and the broad jump have been included. It is expected that, with Rankin running the low hurdles and Tycocki the broad jump, the Riveter team will not suffer very much by this new ruling. Right now there are about 50 men practicing daily. However, on the Wednesday before the Chicago meet time trials will be held and the traveling squad of 26 will be selected. Practice will be continued of course throughout the indoor season. In spite of the pronounced lack of practice with which the Riveters will enter this first meet, the way things are shaping up now there is a good chance of copping the meet. Rankin Gettijig In Shape On February 16 there will be held the annual Illinois relays at Illinois and it is intended to send a number of Gold and Black representa“tives to compete in it. At present Dave Rankin, one ofi;he fastest men on the squad, is the only one fairly sure of making the trip. It will not be until March 1 when Indiana comes here that Riveter fans will get to see tiieir first home meet. Between now and then, however, the squad wiU travel to Iowa for a triangular meet with Iowa and Northwestern. Three Meets In March , ' Three more meets, held on Bfarch 6, 16, and 22 will conclude the' indoor season fmr the Riveters. These meets will be first the Indoor Conference clash, which will be hdd here, then one with Butler there, and finally the squad will top Off the season with a trip to the annual Chicago Relays sponsored by the Chicago Daily News. j.s.k. Boilermaker Mermen Prepare For Michigan On January 25, the Boilermaker tankmen will be in the camp of the Michigan Wolverines for their second dual meet of the new season. The team, just returned from a defeat at the hands of a powerful Northwestern squad last Satmrday at Elvanston, are holding strenuous workouts every afternoon in preparation for the vaunted Michigan attack. The score of 64 to 30 does not indicate the relative strength of the two teams last Saturday, and Coach Dick Papenguth believes that the experience gained in the meet vtill put his squad in good stead for the coming battle. Sophomores Potent The exc^ent showing made by many of the inexperienced sophomores, participating in their first Big Ten meet was a heartening indication of what is to be expected from the Riveter squads in the future. One of the highlights of the meet was furnished by Jqe Williamson, sophomore backstroker, who set a new varsity record in that event when he covered the distance in the fast time of 2:37.2 mmutes. This time clipped more than 4 sws onds off the old record of 2:42 ndp-
utes.

Germans Hope For
Quick Decision... (Continued from page 1)
England did not, and while he undermined the French so thoroughly that he was able later to destroy France, and thereby England’s whole continental position, in literally a few days. But since the war began, and more especially since the attacks on England itself began, this psychological weapon has lost its potency. The Nazi attack on Britain is filled with incredible horror, but the people of Britain have not been psychologically overwhelmed by it, as the French were. They are notably Sane—possibly the sanest people in Europe today—and so Hitler must rely on essentially military methods for conducting his war. Can Hitler Win Long War? But what if Hitler does not beat Britain during the next six months —or the next 12 months? Can he go on fighting longer, and can he still win if he has to go on fighting longer ? The quality of morale is so uncertain in this war, and so unpredictable, that no man in his right senses would think he could be certain of the answers to these questions, Nor can he, with too much assurance, predict to what extent American production can be increased. The speed with which this can be done is of decisive importance. But subject to these reservations, this much, at least, may be said: Hitler most probably can go on fighting longer than six months and longer than 12 months, although it will become increasingly difficult for him to do so, just as it will become increasingly difficult for the British to do so. Still Has Chance To Win And while Hitler’s chances of winning will tend to decline after the next several months—always assuming that British morale holds up and that American aid to itself in the form of aid to Britain becomes effective enough soon enough
—Hitler will still have a chance to win. The gravest mistake the world has made for years, and is still making, is underestimating Hitler and Germany. Hitler, in any event, is making all his arrangements to go on fighting the war, and trying to win it, even if the war should last much longer than six months or a year, and even if it should therefore require the use of somewhat different methods and operations in a considerably larger scale and throughout much more extensive areas. The first objective of Nazi policy is to beat Britain within the next six months, which can be done only by paralyzing the British Isles themselves. The pursuit of this objective is the first motive for Nazi action today. The second motive for Nazi action today is a desire to make all necefesary arrangements for prosecuting the war longer, and in new ways and new places should this first objective prove impossible to achieve.
Creating a ‘New Order’ And there is still a third explanation for much of what the Nazis are doing today: The Nazis are trying to create their “new order” (which a sage and witty diplomat has called the “new disorder”) as they go along in this war, instead of waiting until the war is over, as most countiies at war have done in the past. The Nazis have a dougle motive in this policy of creating a postwar settlement before the war itself is even settled. They want to save time, and be able to begin operations in their own way at the first possible moment and on the largest possible scale, which is highly profitable to them. And they want to discourage their enemies from fighting, by saying, in effect, to them: “There is no use your going on, because we have done so much, and are doing so much, right now to set up the kind of a Europe and the kind of a world we want—the kind of a Europe and world you say you are fighting to prevent— that it will be impossible for you to prevent it, even if you win the wai,
so you might as well quit right now.” Argument Held Specious The argument is specious, of course. But the Nazis hope a lot of people in England, the United States and the rest of the world will not see just how specious it is, and will be at least somewhat discouraged. The Nazis are now engaged in three main military operations, designed to serve these several purposes. They are waging the blitzkrieg against England itself, they are concentrating troops on the whole long frontier with Russia, all the way from the Arctic Circle to the Black Sea, and they are sending some aid to Italy. The primary purpose of the Battle against Britain is to beat the English within the next few months by paralyzing the British Isles. The bombers are the spearhead of this attack, in the sense that the war in the air is more liable to beat Britain quickly than any other form of war except a landing operation, and adequate air preparation is necessary for a landing operation, too. The war at sea is taking a terrible toll of shipping, but of itself cannot beat Britain in the immediate future. Another Main Purpose But the war against the British Isles will also have to be carried on if the war lasts longer than six months or a year. It will, in fact, be at least as important then as it is for a short-term war. In this sense, the attack on England serves the purposes of a protracted conflict, too. And finally the war against England also serves the purpose of setting up a new German world order, because the damage that the Nazi planes and surface raiders and Uboats are doing to the British will handicap England’s ability to function as a national and international economy for years to come, and give Germany and its friends a corresponding advantage. The concentration of troops along the German - Russian frontiers equally serves all 'three of the main Nazi purposes. German - Russian, German - Japanese and German - Italian relations, all of which are
involved in thesd troop movements, will be discussed at more length in subsequent articles in the present series. Nazi Aims in the Balkans For the present, however, this much may be said: Germany wants to protect its rear in the East, chiefly against Russia, for the winter and spring campaigns against England in the west. It wants to secure its own military position in the Balkans apart from the equivocations of Russia’s position. It wants to set about creating its own kind of order in the Balkans for the indefinite future. And it wants to put itself in a position to wage a long war should that prove necessary. For if the war lasts infinitely longer, Germany will want to undertake operations on a greatly expanded scale and in theaters of action where it will not be necessary to fight if England is beaten soon. For to fight a protracted conflict, the Reich would want to drive England out of the Eastern Mediterranean and to secure its own economic position in the Balkans on a sounder and broader foundation
than it is now secured, and it might want to strike southeast toward Baghdad and even at Russia. As for Italy, the Germans have only one main interest for the near future:
They want to be sure that Italy will not collapse, or be stricken by too serious internal disorders or stoppages of production or declines in morale. None of these things, the Nazis think, is liable to happen during the near future even if the Fascists should be driven clear out of Albania and North Africa. Mussolini, the Nazis think, is eminently capable of dealing with anything likely to develop in the near future. There is no reason to suppose that the Reich considers it necessary to “garrison” Italy with large numbers of troops or policemen. While units of both Nazi forces may be in Italy, they are probably there as advisers or observers, or on their way to take up positions elsewhere. There are two more theaters in which operations may be undertaken in the near future: The Germans may move into unoccupied France, and they may move into Spain or Portugal or both.
Would Keep Out of France The Nazis would prefer not to move into unoccupied France. The military advantages of such a move would be inconsequential, and there would be two outstanding disadvantages. First, Prance would tend to react toward a greater degree of coherent national unity; and second^ the large French Army in North Africa, and some of the surviving units of the French fleet would probably go over to the British. If the Nazis go into the Iberian Peninsula it will be primarily to take Gibraltar and thus pinch off the British in the Mediterranean, and to obtain new bases for planes, U-boats, surface raiders—and troop transports—along the British shipping lines to Africa and around the cape, as well as across the Atlantic, and still further bases from which a landing operation against England itself could be undertaken. Hitler has proved often enough that he is a master of surprise. He may strike in one or another of these places or in none of them. He may strike somewhere else altogether. But strike he will — and probably soon.
