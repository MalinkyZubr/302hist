• Lindbergh Returns To Army Service. • Rains, Floods Damage Life, Property. • Coal Shortage Threatens Railroad Service. • Germany Celebrates Hitler's Birthday. WASHINGTON Colonel Lindbergh ... . . . reported for active War Department duty in Washington Wednesday, after being called to help the United States regain military air supremeacy. Lindy has reputedly seen “inside” of Europe’s present fighting air strength. He is scheduled to inspect in detail all government fields, commercial plants, and universities throughout the country. After his tour, Lindy will report confidentially to Air Corps chief Maj. Gen. Henry H. Arnold, recommending developments which he considers necessary to help this country establish its air super-
iority.
G. Stanley Meikle, director of the Purdue Research Relations with Industry, said yesterday, “Nothing at all is definite concerning the possibility of Col. Lindbergh visiting Purdue. However, I am in touch with War Department authorities.” CAA Training... ... at Purdue came before the house Wednesday, as the bill authorizing the Civil Aeronautical Authority to provide training, for 15,000 civilian pilots as a preparedness measure passed and went to the Senate. Said Indiana’s Rep. Charles Halleck after explaining the CAA: “Purdue University was the first school to get this program in operation. I have watched the development of the program there. Fifty boys started in the program. All 50 of them have already qualified for private fliers’ licenses and eight more of them will qualify tomorrow (Thursday).” Actually the eight Halleck mentioned took their exam, but could not exhibit their flying ability because of bad weather. Papers have not been graded yet. On The Spot.. . . . . went WPA this week as .a dou-ble-barreled attack began in Congress. Senate considers a proposal to abolish existing relief systems by setting up a new public works, agency. House leaders are calling for non-payment of money to any worker belonging to the Worker’s Alliance, allegedly communistic in character, official bargaining agent for WPA workers. Seven Indiana republican representatives seek a special congressional investigation of state conditions. Indiana administrator John K. Jennings said in Indianapolis he would welcome such an investigation, and predicted a “clean bill.”

Questionnaire Shows Student Opinion
NATIONAL Heavy Rains .., . . . and swollen mountain tributaries this week caused the Mississippi and Ohio rivers to reach flood stage at hundreds of points. Lowland homes in West Viriginia, Kentucky, Ohio and Indiana were threatened as the Ohio rose over four feet above flood stage at Point Pleasant, W. Va. Thousands of acres along the Wabash were inundated as flood condition approached those experienced last month. Government weather reporters stated that spring rains are at an end, and the flood waters have already begun to recede. Tornadoes ... . . . ripped across five southern states early this week, killing over 40 persons, injuring 10 times that number, and causing upwards of a million dollars property damage. Searchers in Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Alabama, and Arkansas slowly raised the death toll. (Continued on page 2)

In recent years public opinion polls have become a national institution. They have become so important, in fact, that beside mirroring opinion, they undoubtedly lead it. In line with this trend there has appeared recently in the Exponent a series of Institute of Student Opinion articles which supposedly mirror the collective trends on the nation’s campuses. This survey of student opinion was taken on the University campus, and it is the first attempt to obtain opinions on pertinent questions of the student body of this university. This survey was made as a sort of pioneering effort with hopes of future continuance by Earle Aber,
Sci. ’41.
Quiz in Four Parts The questioner, which consisted of 31 queries, was divided into four parts: campus, classroom, national and moral. The blank questionnaires were sent out by campus mail to nearly 600 men and women students, selected so as to represent as near as possible a cross sec-
tion of campus opinion. No signature was required on the returned blanks, and personal interviews were avoided so as to prevent timidity from influencing the answers to the moral questions. The especial value of a poll particular to Purdue such as this is in presenting viewpoints which may be peculiar only to this campus. It was with this point in mind that the campus and classroom questions were compiled. Majority Favor ROTC In spite of frequent voluminous and bitter objections heard so often, a majority favored compulsory ROTC. Results of this question would tend to indicate that intelligent and sincere thought was given to the answers. A topheavy negative answer was given to questions on whether a plan to limit semester hours that a student , might carry should be adopted, and whether college footballers should be subsidized. Tabulated results of the campus questions groqp follows:
1. Should ROTC be compulsory ? Yes, 56 per cent; No. 44 per cent. 2. Would you favor a plan to limit the number of hours that students might carry a semester. Yes, 29 per cent; No, 79 per cent. 3. Do you think that college footballers should be subsidized? Yes, 35 per cent; No, 65 ppr cent. 4. Does Purdue require too much of a student in the way of study in a semester. Yes, 43 per cent; No, 57 per cent. 6. Should there be more liberal arts courses at the University? Yes 68 per cent; No, 42 per cent. 6. Do you think that organized students are favored over unorganized in campus organizations ? Yes, 73 per cent; No, 27 per cent. 7. Would you favor the founding of a course on marriage and sex at Purdue? Yes, 91 per cent; Ifo, 9 per cent. 8. Are final exams worth the time, mental and physical strain for the results obtained? Yes, 12 per cent; No, 82 per cent. An interesting answer obtained
UndismayejJ by weather which forced postponen^ent of the home opener on Ross-Ade Recreation Field twice in the last seven days, the Boilermaker baseball team turned'the back of its hand to the clouds and proceeded to take it out on the Chicago Maroons in both ends of a doubleheader, 8-3 and 2-1.
Bob Bailey, who won his second
start in a row, his second game in a week and both his and the team’s second conference •victory by holding the Maroons to three hits in the first game of the twin bill, and Dkk Wargo, who limited Chicago to the same number of hits in the second tilt, scoring the tying run and batting in the winning marker, were
the stars of the afternoon.
Never In Danger
Bailey, in the first game, was never in serious danger. After the Boilermakers scored five runs in the second inning he let the Maroons make three in the next two frames, then kept them at bay for the last five innings, allowing his third hit in the ninth. He struck out six men. Wargo set down the first two Men he faced in the second game, but after a pop foul had been allowed to drop untouched, Gramer walked and Meyer singled him on home. From then on Wargo slowly mowed do-wn the Maroons permiting only three men to get as far
as second base. Wargo Hits, Too
As if it weren’t enough to pitch a beautiful game, Wargo took it upon himself to open the sixth inning with a single over second basa^ reach second on Lyboult’s sacrifice, and score the tsring run when Dickinson drove a single into left
field.
Thompson doubled with one out in the home half of the seventh, and Art Bredewater flew out, but Wargo again lined a single into center field to send Captain Thompson in with the winning run and give the Boilermakers their third consecutive conference victory without a defeat, placing them on top in the Big Ten standings. . Lopatka, sophomore southpaw who hurled the first game for the Maroons, shone in all departments of the game. Aside from one bad inning, he pitched well, and in the second game played rightfield, making three running catches of potential base hits. He made one of the six Maroon safeties of the day. Thompson Leads Defense On the defensive side no one approached Captain Jimmy Thompson who also smacked a double in each game, the only long hits for the Riveters. In the first game Thompson handled five chances, and in the second game took care of eight more, most of which were hard-hit grounders which he snapped up in a seemingly easy manner. While the Maroons were having their difficulties with the offerings of the two Riveter moundsmen, the Gold and Black players themselves were meeting difficulties. (Continued on page 3)
Armour Tech Head To Speak Here For Engineers' Banquet Dr. Henry T. Heald, president of Armour Institute of Technology, will be the principal speaker at the All-Engineering banquet to be held in the Union ballroom Wednesday,
May 3.
Dr. Heald has been at Armour since 1927, and though only 34 years old, acted as president since October, 1937. He served as Professor of Civil Engineering and Dean of the Institute, before being elevated to his present position. Dr. Heald organized in 1933-34 a common freshman year for all engineering students along lines similar to Purdue’s present first
year plan.
All-Engineering banquet is an annual affair sponsored by Tau Beta Pi, engineering scholastic honorary. Members of the faculty, members of all the engineering honoraries, distinguished students, and upper class co-ed engineers are in-
vited.
Tickets for the banquet, priced at one dollar, may be obtained at the Union desk, the offices of the engineering schools, or from members
of the committee.
Medical Exams Physical examinations for students planning to take the advanced course in military will begin this morning at 8. Those whose names are included in the lists posted in the Armory will report to the Student Health Service at their scheduled times. The exams will con-
tinue next Sunday.

in the classroom questions group in view of the recent campus controversy on ways of securing student honesty on examinations is the overwhelming yes answer on the question on whether the individual student would cheat if the opportunity presented itself. And almost as large a majority preferred that the instructor remain in the room during tests. Evidently the student body wishes to be honest even if they are not in fact. Percentage results in the classroom questions group follow: 1. Should there be compulsory class attendance four years? Yes, 6 per cent; No. 94 per cent. 2. Are present attendance requirements O. K. ? Yes, 77 per cent;
No, 23 per cent.
3. Would you cheat dm'ing an exam if it were at all possible without danger of being caught? Yes, 81 per cent; No, 19 per cent. 4. Would you prefer that the instructor left the room during an exam, and leave you entirely on (Continued on page 4)

Scribe Interviews Barton Of 'Tobacco Road' Amid Paint Jars, Dressing Room Clutter
(Continued from page 1) Greatest massacre was at Center Point, Ark., where 20 persons were killed when high winds collapsed a church during a funeral service. Billions of Grasshoppers ... . . . this week made Coalinga, Cal., their temporary residence, completely halting business as residents fought shoulder to shoulder to stem the horde of hungry insects. Municipal authorities sought outside aid as the attacking army left behind it miles of barren earth and naked trees. Every form of vegetation disappeared as the carpet of grasshoppers advanced on the city. Su-Lin Was... ... a girl they thought, but experts at Chfcago’s Field Museum discovered that Brookfield Zoo’s giant panda, deceased, was a boy. This is not surprising, states Dr. Wilfred H. Osgood, the museum zoologist, in view the fact that nothing at all is known about giant pandas in the first place. Experiments are now under way to determine the sex of Su-Lin’s successor, Mei-Mei. All-Metal “h” Cars ... . . . will soon appear on Chicago’s elevated railway system, due to an order by the Illinois Commerce Commission following an investigation of several “L” accidents of recent date. Replacement of old cars vdll begin within 90 days. BUSINESS Disagreement... . . . between the United Mine Workers of America headed by John L. Lewis and mine operators in the Applachian area over a clause in the new contract took on a serious outlook this week as a coal shortage loomed up as the result of two weeks layoff by 320,000 miners in that vicinity. The clause would make the Union liable for a fine of one or two dollars per man per day for each day of a strike. Lewis issued orders this week to suspend all operations in that field by May 5 if a new contract is not signed by that time with all restrictions stricken out. Such a shutdown would affect some 9,000 miners in Indiana soft coal fields alone, as well as culijiinating activity by the nation’s coal-using railroads. Cupid’s Arrows . . . . . . flew thick and fast this week as the New Deal made a play for the affections of big business. But whether things can be patched up or not will be decided May 1 when Secretary of Commerce Hopkins delivers the principal address at the opening of the 27th annual meeting of the United States Chamber of Commerce. The four-day meeting will be an effort to appease business by suggestion of remedies for national economic problems now confronting both factions. Special emphasis on national income, jobs, taxes, pumppriming, profits and laws affecting business will be the order of the day. s FOREIGN All Germany ... . . . celebrated Adolf Hitler’s birthday this week with a two-day festivity beginning Wednesday. While the celebration continued with the speeches and a great display of military power, Nazi leaders were working behind the scenes on an answer to President Roosevelt’s non-aggression proposal made last ■»i^ek-end. The proposal called for a guarantee of 10 years of non-ag-gression into the 31 European nations. Great Britain Accepted . . . . . . Soviet Russia’s proposal to resurrect the Anglo-French-Russian entente of the World War, it was repoited Fiiday night. In this proposal a militaiy alliance is established to resi.st any possible futui-e aggression by Gei many, Italy, or Japan. Sabotage Was Suspected ... . . . after the Fiench liner Pans overturned and sank at her dock in Le Havre, Fiance, after burning all night Wednesday. Several days ago an anonymous letter warning of sabotage against vessels in Le Havre, was received in a woman’s handwriting and signed with VV BC-82.”
Mary Kay Best Genially smiling through a layer of grease paint and whiskers, John Barton, lead of Jack Kirkland’s “Tobacco Road,” consented to tell some details of his life, personal and public. Born in Philadelphia, Pa., John schools, and has spent 50 of the 63 scholos, and has spent 50 of the 63 years of his life in the theatre. He has traveled over the world, playing in the major cities and towns to acclaiming audiences. Likes Farming And Swing His wife and he were the original team of Barton and Ashley. Though Barton’s brothers are actors and his nephew is the famous Jimmy Barton, Mr. Barton has a secret yen for farming. “I can plant a string and green beans will come up,” he said. In appearance he is of medium stature, possesses a rugged face full of character and determination. Clear blue eyes and a warm smile are his best attributes. His dressing room is a clutter of paint jars, battered costumes, and trunks plastered with names of the places he has been. Fond of music, t*he lovable “Jeeter Lester” of “Tobago Road” especially likes jazz and swing. Blue is his favorite color, and, bless him, he likes women’s hats. He has a passion for water colors, Tennyson, Kipling and Jack London. Mickey Rooney His Favorite A seasoned actor himself. Barton thinks that Mickey Rooney and Ronald Colman tops in the cinematic world. John Barrymore, Walter Huston, Helen Hayes, and Katherine Cornell are his favorites of the legitimate stage. Said Mr. Barton, “I can cast a fly with any man.” And so he can.
Champ Steer Will Appear In Exhibit Here Wednesday Mercer, Aberdeen Angus steer, which won the Grand Championship at the 1938 International Livestock Exposition, will be on exhibit on the campus and in Lafayette Wednesday afternoon. Traveling in a spacious trailer modeled after a modern stock barn, complete with ventilators, feed bins, and the latest sanitary devices, the Champ is making a 5,000 mile tour of the United States. He will be accompanied by a cattle expert, a feeder and a caretaker, and a tour manager. This is the first time that a Grand Champion has made a trip of this kind. Will Be On South Campus Mercer will be exhibited to the general public at the Firestone store, 9th and Ferry, from 1 to 3 o’clock. He will then be moved to the livestock judging pavilion on the south campus of the University so that the students may have an opportunity to view him. The Champ’s handlers will conduct a discussion of the features which made Mercer a champion. The exhibit will then be thrown open for a round stable discussion of cattle breeding and feeding in general. Questions and comments from the audience will be in order at this time.
as fishing is his outdoor sport and eating fish his indoor sport. The next stop for “Tobacco Road” will be at the World’s Fair in San Francisco. It is of import to note that John Barton has brought to the stage such famous plays as “Canalboat Sal,” his first, “Money Talks,” and “Adam, the Second,” and the national favorite, “Uncle Tom’s Cabin.” Before taking his departure for California, Barton stated: “I’ve enjoyed playing here to an interesting and intelligent audience, and shall be glad to come back here in the future. ” Bridge Tourney Goes Into Second Round Wednesday Second qualifying round of the Contract Bridge Tournament will be held in the Union ballroom Wednesday evening at 7 o’clock. All teams who expect to compete in the final round are required to play in this round, according to a statement by tourney i^fficials last night. Julius L. ]^orne, director of the tournament, explained the system under which the tournament is conducted. The teams are divided into flights. Borne then deals out a number of hands equal to the number of teams in each flight. Lady Luck Eliminated These hands are recorded and then transferred to duplicate boards which are passed out when the tournament begins. As each team plays a hand they pass it on to the next table and receive another one. In this way everybody plays the same hands during the evening and the element of luck as largely eliminated from the tournament. Tournament officials announced that any students who have a chemistry test the day after the tourney will be allowed to substitute men in their place for this round. Substitutes will not be required to enter the tournament officially.

Boilermaker Nine Meets Three Squads This Week Having been decidedly disrupted so far this season by the rain-pro-ducing activity of Hoosierland's fickle weather. Coach Dutch Fehring’s diamondmen are hopeful of getting full swing during this coming week with three different contests with three different schools on three different days. On Wednesday afternoon, the Purdue nine will journey to South Bend, to cross bats with the Irish of Notre Dame, a team that is quite a little stronger than last season’s
good Rambler nine.
Friday and Saturday afternoons, the Gold and Blacks will contact the Western Illinois I’eachers’ College club, Friday’s fracas beginning at 4 p, m. and Saturday’s get together
starting at 2 p. m.

running his first race in competition did the 440 yard dash in 49.8 seconds to cut four-tnths of a second off the record set for that distance by Grossman in 1933. Shackleton and Luther followed Fisher aqrqss the line to give the Boilermakers all the points for that event. “Jake” Weber, another basketball player now performing on the track squad, provided the other outstanding performance of the afternoon by tossing the shot 47 feet and 8 inches, well over the former record set by Skoronski in 1935 of 45 feet 7 1-2 inches. Another feature of the ineet was the two mile run in which Knapp, Reeves, and Clevett crossed the finish line together after running the entire distance together. In the pole vault the Boilermakers also took all three places with Hibbs copping first at 12 feet 4 inches. Edwards and Horton tied for second and third. Spectators were left in amazement at the ease with which Simons the colored Wayne star, cleared the bar in the high jump finally jShishing by jumping 6 feet 3 inches. Wayne also proved to be strong in the javelin, the Boilermakers managed to tie for third in this event in order to keep from being entirely shut out. Gutting won both hurdle races and Holderman won the mile and half mile races, their favorite events.

iSifiFieldhouse-A Saga Of Riveter Sport
By H. C. Goebel To the casual visitor on our campus, the Fieldhouse stands for Boilermaker athletics. Every week-end hundreds of visitors inspect the mammoth athletic plant and also the trophy cases and photographs of former athletic teams in the 'halls. These trophies and photographs, seldom noticed by the students, tell the story of Riveter athletics to visitors. Allerton Trophy Basketball is the big sport in Indiana, and our country-wide supremacy in this sport is acknowledged by the Allerton Trophy, a large silver cup in the trophy case at the entrance to the Fieldhouse, emblematic of the Intercollegiate Conference Basketball Championship. By winning the Big Ten title in 1922, ’30, ’32, and ’34, the Boilermakers gained permanent possession of this prized tiophy. In the same case are other cups, plaques, and trophies won by our teams in the past in different major sports, and also the Fraternity pai'ticipation trophy that goes to the Greek letter society that excells in intramural athletics. In the trophy case across the lobby rest footballs and basketballs used in championship games which denote glorious victories on the gridiron and basketball floor. The amazing history of our basketball teams can be followed from the balls used in Big Ten title races of 1911, ’21, ’22, ’26, ’28, ’30, and ’32. Team of 1889 Photographs of athletic squads
start far back with the first football team picture of 1889, and continue down to the present day pictures of the 10 different squads of ' each year. Uniforms worn by the early football and baseball teams cause onlookers to chuckle as they compare them with the modern equipment, and the dress of the coaches in the pictures leaves a good impression of the gay ’90’s. One of the photographs receiving much attention is that of the 1000 per cent basketball team of the 1911 1912 season. This squad under the coaching of R. R. Jones went all season undefeated amassing a point total of 462 points while their opponents were held to but 179. Among their victories was a 45-11 massacre of our beloved enemy, Indiana. In the main office of the coaches in the Fieldhouse is a photograph of the Wreck Squad of 1903. This football team was broken up in a train wreck on a football trip. Eleven of its members were killed, and many more injured. First Four Letter Man On another wall in this office is pictured E. J. Oliphant, the Boilermakers’ first four sport letter man. Ollie received three letters in football, two in baseball, two in basketball, and two in track, and is pictured in each of these uniforms.

Peg Leg Silver And His Cronies Cavort As Puttering Poona Prepares 'Treasure Island'
By Donna Seiss
Long John Silver will again peg his way across Treasure Island on his wooden leg and shout to his mates when the Playshop presents it'' narionettes in the old favorite, “Treasure Island.” Altogether six sets are being made for the pro-
duction.
Crazed Ben Gunn, the stranded hermit of the island, will leave his cave to guide the party through foliage made of green sponges in search of Flint’s treasure. Ingenious putterers in the puttering room have made chairs of pencils and paper for the Tap Room scene at the Benbow Inn. Even such intricate furnishings as pewter plates and beer mugs have not been omitted. Remember Spy Glass Inn? In another set, the Spyglass Inn on the Dock at Bristol, marionette

Reflect Attitude In the results of the national questions the Purdue student body reflected, in the main, the attitude of the college students all over the entire country. A huge majority were convinced that they would not fight in any European war in which the United States became involved. A slight majority favored some such legislation as the Ludlow war referendum. Traditional midwest isolationist feeling was reflected in the larger negative answer to the question of whether the United States should render aid, economic or miltary? in stopping Hitler’s present activities. A majority of the Purdue student body was shown to belong to the Republican political persuasion in that the larger number did not consider Roosevelt a satisfactory president. National Questions Results in this group follow: 1. Would you enlist in a European war in which this country became involved? Yes 30 per cent; No, 70 per cent. 2. Should the American people have a right to decide by vote as to whether to participate in a war ? Yes, 56 per cent; No, 44 per cent. 3. Do you think that the United States should do anything to stop Hitler’s activities ? Yes, 43 per cent; No, 57 per cent. 4. Do you think that communistic and nazi groups should be allowed to hold public meetings ? Yes,
28 per cent; No, 72 per cent. Moral Questions According to their own answers in the moral question group, Purdue students burn with about the same brightness as the rest of the so-called “flaming college youth.” Evidently however, they do not consider themselves in the least immoral. While “necking” was approved with an almost unanimous vote, it is significant to note that only a very slight majority approved of “petting.” Moral question tabulations went as follows: 1. Do you think that occasional drinking is harmful? Yes, 22 per cent; No, 78 per cent. 2. Would you say that the average student drinks toO much? Yes, 24 per cent; No, 76 per cent. 3. Do you think it essential to one’s intellectual development to attend church every week? Yes, 28 per cent; No, 72 per cent. 4. Do you approve of a reasonable amount of “necking?” Yes, 91 per cent; No, 9 per cent. 5. Do you think “petting” is harmful? Yes, 49 per cent; No, 51 per cent. • 6. Do you have a higher estimation of people who do not “pet” than of people that do ? Yes, 49 per cent; No, 51 per cent. High School Students Will Display Art Work At Annual Round-Up Dreams of becoming state champions will be realized for some of the 400 high school students who are expected to attend the annual Vocational and Industrial Arts Round-Up to be held here at the University on Friday, May 5.
