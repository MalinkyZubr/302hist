University To Train 25
Enlistees To Arrive Before First Of /May
Cary Club President For This Semester
The University has been placed on the approved list for both the Army and the Navy for training engineers. The Army is likely to send approximately 500 men to the University to receive college training between March 1 and May 1, and the Navy will probably send a group near July 1. The University’s quota for Army and Navy students is expected to be set at around 2500.
Included in the list of approved institutions were 281 colleges of the nation’s 1700 educational institutions. The Army-Navy plan will eventually affect approximately 250,000 Army and Navy men and women who will be .sent to about 500 of the college.s throughout the country. All men in the specialized training program of the larmed forces will have attended a college before join-
ing' the services.
Will Retain Individuality Since each college while training the Army and the Navy men will retain its individuality, contracts between each institution and the particular branch using the institution must be made. The contracts are expected to be let in the near future and will cover such items as how much payment each college will I'eceive for its services, wheie tpe students will live, where they • will eat, the number of hours per week that will be spent in instiuc-
tion for them, etc.
The University will continue to operate as now with its regular students except that the extra Army and Navy men will be trained
in addition.

Trim lllini In Initial Tilt; Skin Wildcats In Final Largely due to the splendid coordination and teamwork by the entire team, Dutch Fehring’s hard-driving, smooth-work-ing freshman outfit completely outclassed the field yesterday afternoon and evening in the highly-successful quadrangular^ tournament between Indiana, Illinois, Northwestern and the Boilermakers. The Riveters whipped an underrated Northwestern team in the final game last night by a score of 45-32 after trouncing the lllini in an afternoon game 39-23. Dyke Eddleman, the highly publicized Illinois forward, carried off high point honors for the tourney, amassing a total of 30 markers in the two games. Although close guarding by — Boilermaker Charley Haag in the aftei-noon game kept the likeable former prep star's field goals to a minimum, Eddleman managed to. give the fans a good account of himself. He was given a fine ovation as he left the floor during the final minutes of the consolation game.

By Phyllis Mann Women today play a vital and impoitant role in the war effort. Modern industi y has opened a new woild foi them. There is no longer a limit to the fields in which women may choose a caieer—however, women have not as yet been put in the field behind 106’s. Women aie actually encouraged to seek jobs once held by men, in fact one of Wood Hall’s chaperons from last yeai is out flying around and picking up engineering cadettes for CurtissWright. This will icplacc men in mdustiy in order that they may be leleased foi fiont line duty. Education is more valuable as a working asset than evoi bofoie. The college gill Who took one year of geology finds that her services aie in demaml Even the elementary couises 111 astronomy, bacteiiology and engineering drawing are useful. The gill who shows talent for mathematics has found a world tailored to fit her specifications. Physics, electronics, motion and time study, metalluigical analysis, and aircraft drafting and inspection piocedui'es present oppoituiuties in many indusxrios. University Coeds Cooperating This University is contributing to the Avar effort. Many Avomen students of the University, inspired by the demands of the day tor training outside their legtilar cdurses of study, have been enrolled in special war courses. They are taking radio
code woik, pistol firing, and motor repair, along with their Red Cross first aid and knitting classes. The courses have been carefully planned to train Avomeii without previous technical tiaimng or expeiience for a definite niche in war pi eduction. These couises will help focus the women students’ interests, to deteimine how each may fit into seivice. Doing Well In New Jobs Most of the coeds, Avho have taken advantage of the courses offered in the summer session, are using their knoAvledge today “on the job”. Accoiding to Miss Irene Feldt, diiector of the Placement Service for Women, the coeds aie doing so Avell in then new jobs that they regiet not having taken engineeiing couises in college. One of the coeds admits that she IS having the time of her life commuting betAveen Noav York and Dallas. Anothei is tiaveling around the country, one week in Chicago— the next in St. Lpuis. University Is Training Center This University was chosen as one of the eight training centers for engineering cadettes Cor CuitissWright. A group of 115 women with ai least one and a half yoai(s of college and one year of mathematics Avas selected by peisonal intervieAv for a 10-nionth training course. They aviII be tiamed to Avork in the
engineeiing departments of CurtissWright plants after completion of the course. The first five months Avill be devoted to the fundamentals of engineeiing, while in the last five months they Avill be trained in a specific field, according to aptitude and ability displayed in_ the fiist pait of their tiaining peiiod. Many courses of this' type aie being offered throughout the country. They Avill be found invaluable and will give college women something with AA hich to face the changing post-AA'ar world. Women have been found to be superior to men m many phases of wai Avoik. One supervisor found that Avomen who can crochet are able to follow' intiicate color patterns to wire parts in place. He also commended their patience. He said, “the feminine touch is essential in our Avai effort and the Avomen aie qualifying lob these jobs.” Emplo) ment 01 Women Increased More and more Avomeli, every day, aie found capable not only of doing jobs heretofore thought to be for men only, but actually doing them bettor. Since Peail Haibor, the employment of Avomen in war industries has inci eased from 1,500,00 to 4,500,000.^ During the coming year, the government expects one and a half times as many Avomen as men to be employed.

WRONG AGAIN We received a little note the other day from someone who styles himself as a “member in good standing” claiming that neither Theta Chi Cornelius Callahan nor Beta Carl Christensen is the president of that mysterious new honorary, the EPJC (Errol Flynn Junior Commandos);.

A Weak Voice Ftom Bloomington Answers Edit Below is copied An editorial from the Friday edition of the Indiana Daily Student, the Indiana University student publication, in answer to an editorial in the Exponent last Sunday. The Purdue student paper, the Expenent, has warned coeds of the upstate university not to follow the martial footsteps of their Bloomington sisters, the WATC. The Exponent’s most salient objections to the WATC are based on what seems#to them an impractical usage of coed time in subjects military'. The Purdue editors point out that the “Watches” spend precious hours in practical military drill, courtesy and discipline, and strategy and tactics. The cow-college- scribes also object to the “waste” of money and materials for uniforms, which they say are too “fla.shy”. Tn.stead, of these activities,,, the Exponent .suggests that coeds should expend their surplus energies in Red Cross work. They also urge any prospective “Watches” in Lafayette to report to the Red Cross before organizing such a movement. We would like to point out to the Exponent, in behalf of our Women’s Auxiliary Training Corps, that the subjects these young women are learning will be as valuable to them as KP duty is to the average soldier. This training will give them a first-hand knowledge of feminine soldiering, a la college. The Exponent says the role of the woman in this war will be that of the secretary, radio operator, “etc.” We believe that many of the courses taught here in the WATC curriculum will be valuable background for the ,“etc.” jobs. In addition, we say that officers of the WA'VES and^WAACS receive instruction in many of the same course,s disparaged by the Exponent. We are proud of the WATC. ing- of still another .similar club, the ABCDEPGHI (American Boys’ Club for , the Dei'en.se of Errol Plynn’s. Good and Honorable Intentlon.s). However, upon looking, through the directoi'y, your industrious scribe fails to find a Mr. “E” from Dover, and still sticks by Christensen. ’ MORE PINNINGS Wo have heard some news from the Thetas, who have been surprisingly inactive all year. This time two of the girls were pinned on the same week end. The first, Betty Duncan, snared- a Phi Gam from DePauw, while Joan Goss succumbed to Sigma Nu Bill Hammer. We don’t understand thi.s, since Bill’s leaving for the Air Corps w'itl.iin the week. While the cat’s aw'ay, etc., (you know the rest).

Problems For Fun To facilitate’ their consideration, problems should be handed in on separate signed sheets, before 4:30 p. in. Friday of the week after the posting of tlie problem. Include with each solution a si,g'ned statement that Hie solution was obtained unassisted. Solutions are to be handed ill at the Mathematics Office. ' PROBLEM 6: The combined age.s of Mary and Ann are 41 years, and Mary is twice as old as Ann was when Mary was half as old as Ann Will be when Ann is three times as idd as Mary was when Mary was three times as old as Ann. How old is Ann? Problem 5; Three men, travelling with their wives, came to a river which they wished to cross. There was but one boat, and but two could cross at one time; and since the husbands were jealous, no woman could be with a man unless her own husband v/as present. In what manner, did the.y cross the river? Consider also, the same question for the case of two couples and for four couples. Solution: For the case of two couples, the ferrying can be made in fivo trips. For three couples, it takes eleven trips, but for four couples, due to the conditions of the problem, it is impoasihic to move them to the opposite shore. Prof. W. E. Howland ... of the school of Civil Engineering, has written an article, “Economies as a study for the Civil Engineers,” which appeared in the January issue of the Journal of Engineei'ing Education.
