“Purdue”—^“Honesty”—two words. To a few people no more than that just two words."-'
To most, whether they realize it or not, Purdue means someth’ihg more than a merb innh-inadfe word; knd honesty is but the cohdenidtion of a creed, a doetirine that Hves. To most Purdue students, Purdue Honesty means a particular kind’ of honesty.
But it is not.
Honesty, lyhether you call it Purdue honesfy or Delphi honesty; whether you connect it with the'“400” Or with a wandering tribe of
Arabs, honesty is the same; It ddes ‘ not
“Honesty is that quality of man that shows him fair and truthful in speiech, above cheating, stealing, misrepresentatiop, or any othi^r fraudulent actibn.” Honesty does not deviate fibin this definition. i ! Students who do not practice honesty, eith-
