Talndividml The Iowa State of the post-war world will not be a radically changed institution. It will be, however, one that has been expanded and adapted to the needs of that period. * ^ ' s The emphasis of our college in the future WiB he placed squarely oh the individual student, his ability and the quality of his work. This means that mere .numbers of graduating students will count for little, and i^e practical short-term courses for students of lesser ability will increase in popularity. A greatly improved system of cqunseling and vocation testing will be the cornerstone upon iwhich the student will he selected and fitted into the curricula and college which best suit him. The ideal of this post-war institution is a student body completely deviud of misfits, one where every undergraduate is enrolled in the field which best utilizes Ms talents and abilities.' • It is this counseling system also which will be responsible for integrating returning vetj ’ erans into the civilian student body, not as a i special group but as well-adjusted members ', o| the entire body. Of course, there will be many changes in I' "the" curricula. The scientific advances of the . war will mean the revision and expansion of j ’ ' . some fields in a technical school such as this.

In other words, when a retail tire store or garage seUe a tire, it has to send back .to the tire manufacturer the certificates issued by. the 0PA ration hoard. However, the OPA is tracking down reports that these fire certificates, instead of being stampe.d as used, are going back to the dealers, .or else remaining with them in the first place.
