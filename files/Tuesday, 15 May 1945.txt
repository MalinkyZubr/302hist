At first lie could not believe the news was true, and then he knew that it was, and then it came ixf hkn more and more—the things he had rejoined after “fife years and vun month” of e?:ile. “lijiy mother, my brother, my sister, my home—after fife years and vun month,” he kept saying. “None ov you can realize vot jHs means.” A^<i none of us Americans could. We could 4»ly SAy, "It’s so wonderful. You can go |k»^ now. Think of how everyone else is celebrating.” But we could not keep excited because we wanted tp forget that Denmark or any other country had ever had to be freed. So he would explain very carefully agai^ .a]3out his mother and sister arid brother and how the Danish seamen could be sailors for thpir own couritry again now andiiow it had been fife years and vun month under the Nazis—and then he would recount hack hpW Denmark was before the war—what a happy country, how democratic. And he would remember the day he left—^uat before tbe Nazis, and then he would tell again all the thinRs he left at home. * And still we could not really understand. ' iput we Americans who celebrated with turn, began to be afraid, and the fear grew. iPor it seemed that the unpleasant memories of this war were slipping away from too many who stayed at home; I The Danes will remember—those who fought in exile and those wlm fought at bemri' But in America there were too many irtio did not have to fight.
