^rBook Exchange Opens Text Sale Tomorrow
Ending its first day in the third year of operation at 5:30 p. m. yesterday, the student book exchange j closed up shop with over 500 books in stock. Union workers will be on the job in the Union ballroom again today to receive texts which will be offered for sale beginning tomor- ^ row. Indication of the growing prestige of the non-profit exchange” was I ^ evidenced by the receipt of seven I books through the mail from a stuI dent who is not returning this fall. I Eoger Fisher, a freshman engineer I last year, has received an appointS ment to West Point, and mailed in I his books to be sold by the exchange, according to Vincent HruI . by, activities chairman for the Stu- ; dent Union. ^ y Books will go on sale tomorrow I from 10 a. m. to 5:30 p. m., and on I Thursday from 10 a. m. to 8 p. m. ■fc Prices are set by the individual I whose book is being sold, and the ' ^ transaction is handled through the i I exchange vdthout charge. I I Because of its success in the past 5i and the promising outlook from the ft ^ first day’s activity, Hruby believes ' that the record of 3,400 books sold I last year will be broken. I Philatelic Society i y Meets Tomorrow Tomoirow night the Lafayette Philatelic Society will hold its first weekly meeting of the new school year in the Agriculturalist office on the second floor of the Union across from room A.

YWCA Will Sponsor Get4cquainted Tea YWCA members will entertain all co-eds at a tea to be held Thursday afternoon, September 14, at 4 o’clock in the Women’s Lounge of the Union. The tea will serve as an opportunity for freshmen women to become acquainted with faculty members and upperclass members. At this time freshmen women are urged to feel free to consult Miss Clare Coolidge and members of the faculty advisory board who will be present to help advise incoming co-eds. Catherine Cooley, president of YWCA, has annoimced that a booth will be maintained at registration and at the tea where membership cards may be obtained for the usual fee of $1 per year.

Sunday vesper services to be held regularly throughout the year are to feature inspirational and educational talks by faculty members. The first of these will be held September 17 at 5 o’clock in the Women’s Lounge of the Union. Agronomist Writes Paper On Alfalfa Produdion M. 0. Pence, Purdue extension agronomist, is the author of “The Essentials of Alfalfa Production,” a new publication just issued by ths University Department of Agricultural Extension, as Bulletin No. 242, Pence outlines the rapid increase in alfalfa production in Indiana during the past ten years and gives suggestions for the best ways to grow the crop on Indiana farms. These suggestions are based on the experience of Indiana farmers and the results of soil experiments.

Old Students Rush Through First Day Of Registration; Freshmen Start Today
Students Vote For Class Senators At Registration In addition to the confusion of registration, students of the sophomore, junior and senior classes are facing the, prospect of choosing their class representatives for the student senate. In charge of the voting under the direction of senate president Fishbum is Martin Estey. The ballot booth is located near the registration exit door and like every other poll on election day, it will be found surrounded by several ardent campaigners. Elections have assumed the real
Registration of University students began yesterday at 8 o’clock with the usual rush of distinguished •students, athletes, and others having early registration. Following this initial rush the regular registration of “good” students (i. e. students without conditions or failures from the pre'vious semester) began. Although officials in charge refused, for unknown reasons, to di-^ vulge the actual number of persons registering during the first day, unofficial estimates placed the number at over 2,100. Although neither this number nor the number of freshmen reported to have participated in orientation exceeds that of last yfer, the total enrollment of the University is expected to rise somewhat above last year’s 6,700. Registration will continue throughout today and part of tomorrow for old students. Freshmen with orientation numbers from 1 to 308, and from 551 to 1670 will register today, while the remaining frosh will make out their class cards tomorrow. The registration period officially closes with the opening of classes Thursday, September 14. Physical examinations for freshmen were well underway today as the Student Health Service offices in the Executive Building were turned into a clinic for the new eds. Co-ed physical examinations are being held in the Memorial Gymnasium. Governor Townsend Names Professor Lommel State Planning Board Chairman George E. Lommel, professor of topographical engineering in the school of civil engineering, has been named chairman of the Indiana State Planning Board, it was announced recently by Governor M. Clifford Townsend. Professor Lommel, who has been a member of the board since its organization, succeeds Virgil M. Simmons, director of the department of conservation. He has had nearly thirty years experience in planning and is generally recognized as one of the leaders in the planning of the state as well as the middle west. Park Board Draftsman After graduating from the University in civil engineering in 1910 he started his career as chief draftsman for the Indianapolis Park Board. From there he went to Los Angeles as landscape engineer and in 1912 joined the University’s civil engineering staff, taking charge of the organization of planning instruction here. In addition to his instructional work here, he has done much to make Indiana planning conscious through his extension work with the engineering department, organizing various short courses and conferences. He has also been called into consultation by various city planning commissions.
Music Clubs Plan I Tryouts Thursday Students interested in musical organizations are invited to attend a mass meeting to be held in Eliza Fowler Hall tomorrow evening at 7:16. Registration and information concerning the tryouts which will be held on Thursday and Friday will be given at that time. The music organizations which will be represented at the gathering include the University Orchestra, Glee Club and Choirs.

Miss Helen Knight of the physical education department who visited in New Mexico during the summer will give a short talk using illustrations of jewelry and dances she collected from the Indians. Following Miss Knight’s talk, WAA council members and heads of sports will be introduced. The sports calendar for this fall which will include swimming, tennis, hockey, riffery, and badminton will be announced. In order to get an early start on this fall’s activities, a membership drive is being held now. Dues, which are $1.00 for the year, may be paid at the WAA table outside the Armory.

NYA Increases Student Help With a waiting list of approximately 360, and more applications being received every day, the National Youth Administration already has about 800 students slated for jobs during the coming year. G. R. Sharp, NYA executive, stated that there will probably be an increase over the number of students who received help last year because there is an increased budget to work with. However, even with this increased number, there are still many eligible students who cannot be helped. Mr. Sharp also stressed the fact that only students who are in need of financial aid and who can prove their need for help may be assisted by the NYA.
Seventy Men Spend Nine Weeks At Ross Camp During Summer; 7 Girl Commutes
Civil camp was home for 70 men and one girl for nine weeks this summer. At least it was home for the 70 fellows, but Annabell Teeter, co-ed civil, commuted from home to camp each day. The three buildings and pool are only part of the “summer resort” layout. The camp was given to the University by David E. Ross, president of the board of trustees, whence the name Ross Camp. Ross owns land adjacent to the camp property. For the first time in camp history there were el^ctnc lights.
One of the first things accomplished at camp was the formation of six softball teams, each headed by one of the faculty campers. Swimming and a little hard ball took up all spare time. There were several tournaments held during the summer. Ping pong, “38”, and tennis were played. Prof. Freele, who was in charge of camp improvement, had work going at top speed for the last three weeks. Each summer the campers try to leave thejCamp in better condition than they found it.'<'1

Catalogs From 575 Colleges Proves That Purdue,Isn't So Tough After All
Freshmen, if in the future Purdi^e sometimes seems like the wrong. choice for an alma mater, especially when the factor labels are tougher th^ usual, just be consoled. You mi^t have done worse (or better) ass \hown over in the Education building"library by a comparison of catalogs from 675 colleges collected from every part of the United States. New York has the highest number, with catalogs from fortyone colleges throughout the state. Pennsylvania runs a close second with forty, and thus the collection goes, down to representatives from Territory of Alaska, Hawaii, Porto Rico, and the Philippines, completing the assortment of catalogs from every state in the Union. Country Clubs? The University of Arizona plays Chamber of Commerce by extolling the healthful climate there. Typical of the western colleges is the Colorado School of Mines, which brags about the surrounding scenery. Their specialty is mountain hikes which can be taken on free afternoons. At the University of Virgima an honor system is fully enforced. This university has in its background such benefactors as Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and James Monroe. Ti;i§kegee Institute in Alabama was founded by Booker T. Washington purely as a negro college because provision for negro education is required by law, and negroes are not allowed in imiversities for whites in the South. At Rollins College, Winter Park, Florida, is the Walk of Fame. This walk is composed of stones from the birthplaces of the famous men of the country, including those of every president. M.I.T. Tries Hard. The most beautiful catalog is that of Temple University which was prepared by the Oswald Advertising Agency. It dramatizes the whole story of the University by unusual photographic studies. Purdue’s rival, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, features super high speed pictures, taken at 1-175,000 of a second. At the University of Philippines, pants and shirts are required for daily wear, but ties, shoes, and hats are optional. What a haven for heat-worn students! In Illinois, at Wheaton College, no dancing, drinking, smoking, or motion pictures are allowed. Entertainments there are in the form of picnics, hikes, and chapel. It Ain’t So Bad Here So if there still lurks an ambition to be a Harvard man, a Vassar woman, or a desire to go to Maine or Texas Christian, just “count your blessings” and realize that Purdue compares favorably with a lot of other colleges, in spite of its hard work and rainy weather.
Foresters Att^d Clark County Camp Forestry camp, located in a 6,000acre tract of land in the Clark County State Forest, opened June 11, under the direction of Prof. C. G. Geltz. The hrst job of the foresters was to open and air the buildings ( which had been closed all winter. A. M. Herrick, of the forestry department; G. E. Spencer and J, W. Hubler, of the engineering department; and O. M. Davenport, of the forestry department, supervised the study. The first night supper was eatefi at the CCC camp. Study Period Divided The first day was spent in orientation and a tour of the forest. “Frosty” Miller, For. ’31, is custodian of the foresT. The camp period was divided into three divisions. Study was divided into Dendrology, mensuration, and surveying, each subject getting one-third of -the period. The second week camp was visited by Major Henry W. Lawson, expert saw filer and demonstrator for the Atkins Saw Co., and Paul “Bunyan” Criss, of the Kelly Axe Co. Campers were instructed in the proper use and conditioning of saws and axes. Saturday, July 8, the campers’ baseball team defeated the ^H^iyville Dare Devils 6-0. Timber Cruising The last two weeks groups of two campers were assigned the job of mapping, surveying, and timber cruising a 40 acre tract of land. By the time camp closed 320 acres had been so covered. Pranks of course were played on the more hapless members of camp. Russ Weller found his bed atop the bath house at 11 o’clock one night, after he had had to walk back from Polaris observations. Carl Hoelzer later found his bed on the pump house roof. He climbed to the roof;

The famous “All - American” marching band will open its season at the Purdue-Notre Dame football game September 30, at Notre Dame, with an artistic performance designed to provide new thrills for spectators and to make new advances in band formation technique, lu addition to the Notre Dame game, the band has definite plans for attending games at Northwestern University, November 11, and at Indiana University, November 26.^ Larger Band The general level of musical ability of incoming players this year promises to be the highest in the history of the band. Due to increasing interest in high school bands throughout the country it will not be possible to admit all who apply for membership in the band. Membership will be increased to 160 pieces, however, in view of the increased facilities which will be available upon completion of the new Music Hall about February 1, 1940. It is planned to increase the band up to 300 men within the next five years in order to give oppor'tunity to those who wish tq play. With the purchase of 12 new glockenspiels, the band can boast of

“Ddspite the low farm prices this last summer, we have had a growing increase in the enrollment in the school of agriculture,” said Prof. V. C. Freeman, recently appointed associate dean of agriculture, in a conference yesterday. “This is one phenomenon that is immeasurable that there are indirect growing interests of farm boys for training in the fields of agriculture.” This year officials believe there will be well, over 300 freshmen ag students register next week. As in former years it is expected that over 60 per cent of the ag enrollment will be made up of 4-H Club members. Last year official statistics showed that 63 per cent of the students taking ag were former 4-H members. Again this year 90 to 95 per cent will hail from the home state of Indiana.

Cary Hall Residents Await Completion Of South East Hall From a comparatively small beginning in 1928 Franklin Levering Cary Memorial Hall has grown from a single building housing 156 men to a nearly completed quadrangle equipped to take care of 1,060 students. , In 1938 the first addition, Franklin Levering Cary Hall, North, consisting of rooms for 116 students and two additional units (Northwest and West), housing 116 and 166 men, respectively, were completed. New Unit Incomplete For the past eight months work has been in progress on Cary Hall, South. This new unit, when completed, will accommodate over 400 students. It was planned to have this latest addition completed in time for the fall session, but due to labor trouble and other difficulties over which the University had no control, the opening of the complete unit will be delayed for a short time. West Wing Ready The west wing of the South Hall is ready for occupation now and students will be allowed to move into theii; assigned rooms in the remainder as soon as it is turned over to the University. In the meantime all. freshmen and new Cary Hall residents who were to be lodged in the east wing of the south hall will live in the regular residence wing of the Union Building. All old residents

Military Program Starts Thursday Corps Will Enter 63rd Year With Excellent Rating; Kizer And Elward To Address Brigade After Inspection By Co/. Beere At 11 o’clock, Thursday, September 14, the University Military Department will launch its 63rd year with the formation of the brigade for Corps Day review. When the formation of the brigade is completed, it will be presented to Col. D. M. Beere, Professor of Military Science and Tactics. Short talks will be addressed to the Corps by Noble Kizer, University athletic director, and Mai Elward, football coach. This will be followed by Purdue cheers and songs.
Largest in U. S.
Since its inception in 1876, the Purdue Cadet Corps has grown to the largest Field Artillery unit in the United States. The Corps consists of four regiments of eight batteries each, a total strength of approximately 2,760 men, 350 of which are advanced course students, 900 sophomores, and 1,500 freshmen. Fifteen officers of the Regular
last year 168 graduates were commissioned as Reserve officers.
Army are stationed at Purdue and act as instructors. In addition a number of enlisted men serve as drill sergeants. Advanced course students act as commissioned officers, and basic students, freshmen and sophomores, serve as privates and non-commissioned officers. The basic military course consists of five hours a week. The new infantry drill adopted September 1 by the Wai Depaitment will be used this year at Purdue. This drill does away with the old squad formation, thus eliminating the commands “squads right” and “squads left”. It is considerably simpler than the old formation and better adapted to modern combat formations. Organized by Dr. Wiley The history of the Purdue Cadet Corps began in 1876 when, as a company of infantry, it was drilled under Dr. Harvey W. Wiley of the faculty, later nationally known in connection with the Pure Food and Drug Act. Soon after the Corps ceased to function, and did not again become active until 1887 when it was rehabilitated by Lieutenant Wolff of the Swedish Navy. In 1888 the Corps for the first time came under the direction of a Regular Army officer. Col. Andrew Pickering . Military Training at the University became compulsory in 1891 under orders of the President. The Corps which had numbered 92 in 1888 now included 1057 men. In this same year the first military band was organized. It had 12 pieces. Disbanded At the outset of the SpanishAmerican War, the ROTC was dis-
banded and was not reorganized until 1902. Credit hours for military training were first given in 1909 when the Purdue unit had grown to one of the largest in the nation. The customary pacifist movement that comes approximately ten years after every major war engulfed the campus in the year 19101913 and brought a low ebb in military training at the University. The yearbook of 1911 devoted but one page to the military department; a picture of the Commandant appeared with the caption; “Purdue Army, biggest piece of foolish foolishness on the campus. Just one damn drill after another.” Armory Built in 1916 Contracts for the construction of the first brick armory were let in 1916. It was completed in 1918 at the cost of $200,000. ROTC was suspended again January 1, 1918, to make way for the Students Army Training Corps under the direction of the War Department. During the war 3,868 Purdue students, graduates, and faculty members were in the service. Excellent Rating When the ROTC was reestablished in 1919, an all Field Artillery unit was organized under the provisions of the National Defense Act of 1916. From this time until the present day the Corps steadily grew in numbers and excellence. The unit has been rated “Excellent”, highest possible rating, every year since 1923 when the present system of national inspections was instituted. Purdue’s contribution to national defense has been noteworthy;
In addition to regular drill and classroom work many voluntary activities in the way of competitions and special drills are open to members of the Corps today. The pistol team. Zouave squad, and the Military Ball are activities sponsored by the military department.
Students Average t3.4 Trips To Health Service Last Year “The Purdue Student Health Service is anxious to have all students who'" become ill or have injuries come in to the health offices immediately after the injury or sickness for immediate treatment. In this way we can keep such ailments from becoming serious.” Thus Dr. Sayers John Miller, director of the University student health service, explains the aims and usefulness of the health service. One of the Best Dr. Miller, his three assisting physicians, two trained nurses, a lab technician, and a clerical staff of
two stenographers and 16 students, boast one of the best student health services in the country. Last year they treated 90,000 student cases. With a possibility .of 6,676 students to take advantage of the ser-> vice last^ar, 96.7 per cent used the service." Foi; the first time complete ^physical examinations were given all seniors in cooperation with the personnel department. Student Hospitalization At the beginning of school last year 2,697 ‘^physicals” were given
new students, During the yeaf the number of examinations reached 7,386. Included in the $6 health fee that each student pays is hospitalization. Last year the health department sent 988 students to the hospital for one day or more. These students compiled a total of 3,336 days of hospitalization. Prescriptions given by the physicians of the department are filled, without charge, by the University school of pharmacy.

1940 DEBRIS
Seven Religious Convos Scheduled For This Year With seven of the nation’s outstanding speakers scheduled for the forthcoming year, reli^ous convocations should reach a new high. In charge of religious convocations, Dr. Lawrence Hadley states: “It is our aim and ambition to bring to the campus the best preachers of America.”
First ConvQ 0«^ B9 The first convocation is scheduled for Sunday, October 29, with Dr. Ralph Sockman of New York City as the speaker. Dr. Sockman has spoken on this campus for three consecutive years in the past. On November 19, Monsignor Fulton J, Sheen of the Catholic University of America will be the speaker. Last year on his visit to the campus he addressed an overflowing audience in Elizabeth Fowler hall. Christmas Program The Christmas music program will probably be given on two consecutive days, according to Dr. Hadley. The first day for the music has been tentatively set for December 16.
Dr. Romert Russel Wicks will lhake his third appearance on this campus on January 21, the date set for the last program of the semester. Dr. Wicks is Dean of the Princeton University chapel and one of the most popular speakers to visit this campus. Second Semester Three religious convocations are scheduled for the second semester. The dates for these are February 18, when Rabbi A. H. Silver of Cleveland, Ohio, will address the students; March 21, which has been tentatively set for the first day of the Easter music; and April 14, when Ur. Ralph "M. Davis of Oakland, Calif., will be the speaker.
Debris Staff Plans Streamlined Scends As Theme Of Swing Styled Yearbook streamlined scenes will be the theme of this year’s Debris^ according to tentative plans announced by the new Debris staff. No surrealisms, worlds of tomorrow, or jitter-bug pictures, but definitely a swing version of a yearbook. A special twelve page section of snapshots submitted by the student body will be included in this year’s book. All students are invited to contribute their best pictures of themselves or of their friends to the special box which will be provided for
this purpose in the Debris ofifice.
Students submitting pictures are ' ' ' ' ■
asked to include with them a brief description of who the person in the picture is and the circumstances under which it was taken. They are also asked to include their own name and telephone number so that the Debris staff may get in touch
with them.
Debris will go on sale at registrationfor?4 accordmgtoastateA.«t/ by Dick McNeil, business manager of Debris. Throughout the year the price will be increased until it reaches $5. Over 2,600 books "^ere
sold last year.
Slogan for this year’s Debris is “100 Per Cent Coverage of the Campus.” There is no reason why every student should not have his or her picture in this year’s Debris, accord-
ing to McNeil.
Pictures are already being taken in order to faithfully cover campus life from orientation to final exam-
inations.

taken by the Fraternity President’s Council last spring in th§ formulation of a fraternity cooperative buying plan, Joe Donovan, Alpha Chi Rho, made a culminative study of four fraternity houses itemizing every food-buying amount and cost. He then took 15 more fraternities and studied them for a month. Pursuing farther along this line he asked local merchants and warehouses their prices on large amounts of the same essentials and his findings indicated that a saving of from five to six per cent “’would be pos-
sible.
At the present time 26 fraternities have indicated their willingness to cooperate in this mass buying plan. Contracts are being drawn up for inspection by fraternity house managers and vote by house committees. These contracts will pro-> vide for a specified period of supply o| food essentials consisting at present of meats, baked foods, dairy products, canned goods, coal, and groceries. An executive committee consisting of Ken Houston, Alpha Chi Rho; Bob Viehe, Phi Gamma Delta; John Cochrun, Phi Kappa Psi; and Bill Breuer, Sigma Chi, has been selected to carry on the activities of this group. The group will select a manager who will be in charge of all pmchases of food and the other listed commodities. Passports Change Color; Size And Shape The Same With the exception of the freshmen, passports for the coming year will differ in color from those in use last semester. The fresh will retain their traditional green, sophomores will have pink passports, juniors will have yellow, and seniors blue, the size and shape remaining the
same.
In addition to the student’s picture, which^APpears on the cover with his name, age, local address, the telephone number, the passport will contain tickets for home football and basketball games. The passports are not only necessary for entry to football and basketball games but axe used for admission to convocations and for general identification throughout the
year.'-f'; ■ M

THE PURDUE EXPONENT
Tuesday* SeplenAer 12, 1939
Exponent Enters 51st Year; Daily Publication Since 1906
This fall the Exponent enters upon its 61st year of publication. Back in 1889 the first monthly edition of the Exponent appeared. It was a 25page magazine-type paper, published by the four campus literary organizatipns. Nine years later the monthly became weekly. The Expwient lost its magazine likeness and became a four-page newspaper. This size continued for the year only, and the following year found the Exponent again a literary magazine. Daily in 1906 Not until 1906 did the paper become a daily. This paper was five columns in width. Two years later the familiar “Notice” column appeared, replacing the University Calendar. “News of the World,” the forerunner of “News of the Week” now printed every Sunday morning, was started in 1910. The next daily column to appear with regularity was “Camp Purdue News.” It was started in 1918 and was under the supervision of the military department. In the fall of 1918 the paper suspended publication. Publication was practically impossible as most of the staff was enrolled in training camps. But the •paper reappeared in the fall of 1919. Birth of B & B The paper’s scandal column was started January 4,1923. It appeared that morning headed by a large question mark. A prize was offered for the best name. “Bold and Black” was selected, and the column, under that heading, has continued except for temporary, lapses when editors were scarce.
From 1923 to 1926 the Exponent featured “Billy Stiff” and “The Family Next Door,” two daily comic strips. April 1,1927, the University chapter of Sigma Delta Chi, national journalistic fraternity, published the first razz edition. These are now published occasionally during the school year. During the summer session of 1937 the first summer Exponent was printed. Its predecessor was the mimeographed Summer Session Notes. Editorial Campaigns Fifty-one years has seen the Exponent as champion of many campus campaigns. Probably the greatest editorial campaign started on March 3, 1919, in an editorial suggesting some type of memorial for Purdue’s war dead. Ten years later
the Memorial Union building was a realization of this. October 26,1898, found the editor urging all members of the football team to attend practice regularly so they would be able to “hold Chicago to a small score.” 1919 found the Exponent campaigning for a million dollars which had been awarded the University, but the legislature ignored. The same year the paper came out as opposed to cheek-to-cheek dancing as immoral. Political Dabbling In 1924 the first political editorial appeared in the paper’s editorial column. The editor decided that the entire student body should go on record for the election of Calvin Coolidge. Twelve years later the editor wrote pro-Republiean editorials during the campaign of 1936.
Marloneite Production Tenfalively Scheduled For Last Week In Odober At last it seems to have arrived. The long awaited marionette show due last spring is under production at present with Joe Martin, Sc. ’40, as casting director. In charge of
costumes will be Sue Enders, Sc. ’41. At the time of this writing the sets and costumes are completed and other details are being attend€^d 'to. The dates of the performance are tentatively set for the last five days in October. ' A cast of new and old members of the Marionette Group will be selected to record the voices of the marionettes. These voices will be replayed during the production, pro-
ducing the effect of human speech in the show. All freshman and others interested in this sort of activity are invited to get in touch with W. D. Archibald, Sc. ’42, in the puttering room of the Union which is tlie center of the group’s activities. , Snbscribe for THE EXPONENT

The scheduled morning practice was disrupted by the fact that the bulk of the squad was busy at registration.
Frosh Will Answer Call For Intramual Managers' Positions \ Fraternity freshmen who are planning to try out for the Intramural Manager’s positions are asked by “Chief” Clevett to report to room 111 in the Fieldhouse, Thursday, September 14, at 4 o’clock to receive instructions nad sign up. The freshmen will assist'in conducting the Intramural sports program, and will be expected to report every weekday afternoon'during the semester. At the end of the semester two sophomore assistant managers and one alternate manager will be elected from this group. One of these assistant managers will be elected Intramural Manager at the end of his sophomore year, his service ending at the end of his junior year. Recompense. The awards for this work are a trip to the Big Ten Athletic Conference in Chicago, an intramural sweater to the three assistants at the end of the freshman year, and a “P” sweater to the manager in his junior year. The selection of managers is made by M. L. Clevett, Larry Imhoif, Miss Mary Leadbetter, and the Intramural Manager, and is purely on the basis of merit. All freshmen who are interested in this type of work are urged by Clevett not to miss this opportunity to gain experience in the handUng and planning of athletic events. Holderman Picked As Best Prospect For Cross Country “One of the best prospects in the country today,” said Coach Phillips in referring to Ed Holderman, sensational junior distance man, who is expected to lead the cross country team to victory this fall. Holderman finished fourth in the national collegiate meet last summer with a time of 4 minutes and 13.8 seconds, no mean feat for such a youngster. Ed is regarded as a better cross country man than a miler which leads many to expect him to enjoy a very successful season. Gaulke Captains Team A1 Gaulke, captain of the team, is also being counted on to score for the Boilermakers this fall. A1 is a senior, as is Denzler, another veteran back from last year. Juniors returning include Chuck Reeves and Mack White and the cause will be helped along by a large crop of sophomores who composed last year’s freshman squad which performed very well then. The first meet of the year will be against Pittsburgh on October 14 in the Smoky City. Indiana, Illinois, and Wisconsin complete the intercollegiate schedule and the teams will then compete in the state, conference, and national meets All-Campus, Class Tennis Entry Deadline Friday; Tourney Opens Saturday Opening the intramural sports season, competition in the men’s all-campus and class tennis tournaments will begin Saturday morning, September 16. Entries may be made on the bulletin board across from the checkout window in the basement of the Fieldhouse. The entry deadline is Friday evening. The winner of the all-campus tourney will receive a trophy with a figure of a tennis performer. In the class tourney the winner receives a gold key, while the runnerup is awarded a silver key.
Twenty-four major lettermen, including idle “Three 'Bees”, Lou Brock, Jack Brown, and Mike Byelene, were among the squad that reported to Coach Mai Elward. In view of the fact that the practice time available before the Notre Dame game is limited Mai indicated that actual scrimmage may be on the program for this afternoon. Short On Practice In spite of the severity of their schedule, the Boilermakers will launch their season with less actual practice time than any other major eleven. Mai emphasized the fact that every minute must be made to count. Since regularly scheduled classed start on Thursday, the Riveters have only today and tomorrow to have double drill sessions. Starting Thursday the squad will only be able to have single practices after classes. * Yesterday’s practice session was devoted entirely to the basic fundamentals. Only light work, including Icicking, passing, wind sprints, and practice on the tackling dummies, was on the program. Intensive work will be in order starting at this morning’s drill. Greatly encouraged by the fine physical and mental condition of the entire .squad, the Boilermaker coaching staff believes that the spirit of the team is as enthusiastic and as belligerent as that which brought last year’s eleven through their schedule with only one defeat.
^koIxJL By Robert J. Deckard
After the 20-page edition of the Exponent made its appearance last Saturday with FC making the statement that the Boilermaker football brigade during the coming season will be a piuch better outfit than the ’38 squad, several lads have quizzed us and made the infernal interrogation: Why? —fc— Briefly, here is the answer relative to how the Boilermakers shape up: Guards: short on reserves—only three lettermen returning—^but the trio are experienced men, capable of assuming any hardships coming their way. Tackles: probably be slightly weaker than last year at the outset but ought to get better. Ends: Coach “Mai” Elward beams over his flankmen. Center: about the same as last year. Remember that Augie Morningstar, who is number one candidate for this post, played in the majority of games during regular center Paul Humphreys’ absence due to an injury. Backs, undoubtedly the finest set of ballcarriers in the Big Ten. Stronger on the whole than the ’38 contingent. More versatile. More experienced and faster. This is mainly the answer to the question “Why”. —fc— There is a rumor going around among Purdue fans that Elward will take advantage of his flying B’s, namely Lou Brock, Jack Brown, and Mike Byelene, in a different way. In order to utilize these three halfbacks simultaneously during a game, one of the trio may possibly be changed to a fullback, solving the problem at that position which is short, at the present time, of material. —fc— Personally, we like this lead paragraph of an article written by Harold Harrison, Associated Press sports writer: ., Purdue’s victory bell is going to ring many, many times during the coming football season.”
Decathlon Planned By Phillips For Fall Track Workouts Another of Track Coach Hermon
Phillips’ ideas to add interest in the sport will be introduced this fall when thinly candidates will compete in a decathlon to determine the best
all around athlete of the squad. The entire squad, excluding those
on the cross crounty team, will try their hand at the 10 events composing the decathlon, and the best times which they make will be used in deciding their ratings foif the season. The 66-yard dash, 330-yard dash, and 660 and 1,320-yard runs along with the 120-yard low hurdles
will comprise the track events.
The running broad jump, running ^ which is located three blocks west high jump, discus; hop, skip, and-^ of the campus.
WBAA To Broadcast All Football Basketball Encounters This Year
Fraternity Softball Tournament Begins Monday Afternoon Due not later than noon Friday,
September 16, the entry blanks for intramural softball teams must be submitted to the Intramural Office. A schedule of six games will be arranged for each team, the site of the games being at Intramural Field,
jump; and the shot put with the 12pound shot will be the field events to tax the strength of the track
men.
With such variety, Phillips believes that the interest of the thinlies should be high all during the fall season and at the same time keep them in condition. Ratings will be figured up at the end of the fall season and the standings will show the best all around men of the group. The plan will also give Freshman Track Mentor Wilkening a chance to get a good idea of the talent of his new crop of yearlings. These men will compete along with the upper classmen and will be rated on the same standing. Riveter Billiards Coach Wins Match Using experience to good advantage, F. E. Whitney, Boilermaker billiards coach, defeated J. J. Spaugh, ’27, in an 18.2 Balke Line handicap billiards match last night in the Game Room of the Uliion Building by a score of 200 to 86. This more difficult method of playing the game proved a bit puzzling to Spaugh, who is an outstanding straight-rail billiards artist, but who has had little experience playing the 18.2 Balke Line. In order to win the match, Whitney was compelled to overcome a 50 point handicap. With an average of slightly more than 6 points per inning, Whitney made his 200th point after 33 innings. His high run netted him 31 points, which is much better shooting than average! A 19 point high run was Spaugh’s best effort. Preceding the match, Mr. Whitney announced that a freshman" pocket billiards, “rotation pool” tournament will begin today. The tourney serves largely as a search for talent to represent Purdue in the intercollegiate billiards tournament against nearly 100 other college teams next spring. With the freshman prospects lining up favorably, 40 men have already entered, although the entry deadline is not until next weekend. The plan of the tournament is to eliminate all but close to half a dozen players by single-loss elimination. That is, one loss puts a player out. The remaining six players will play in “round robin” style, with the player having the most wins at the end being declared the victor.
Chief Clevett announces that practice games will be held on Monday and Tuesday, September 18 and 19. When all the games on the schedule are played off, the eight highest teams will enter tlm finals. The schedule is on the bulletin board. All of the encounters are scheduled to start at 4:16. If a team fails to appear on the field before 4:30, the opposing team will be awarded the game by forfeit. Equipment For each contest the teams must supply a bat and a ball. The 14inch rubber covered baills which will be used ,are on sale at Deac’s and Deckers’. Official scorebooks must be gotten at the check-out vandow before 4 o’clock the day of the game. The length of all games will be five innings. The teams are expected to supply their owh officials. However, the selected officials may be removed on protest of either team captain. On the intramxiral bulletin board may be found maps showing the location of the different diamonds on Intramural Field. A copy o± the rules should be on hand for each game. Clevett states that unless the teams plan to pay the trophy fee within the next month or two, the softball entry blatiks should not be returned. Do’s and Don’ts The National Softball rules (revised January, 1939) will be the playing rules for this year, with the following exceptions: (1) A fourteen inch ball will be used; (2) local ground rules—fly balls over or through the fence on the even numbered diamonds (2, 4, etc.) are counted for two bases only; (3) no bunting is allowed with the 14-inch ball; (4) on a passed ball, a base-runner may not score from third; and (5) base-runners may not leave their bases until the ball has reached the batter. All protests must be made in writing to the Intramural Director within 48 hours. If the official’s work proves unsatisfactory, teams may borrow someone from a nearby diamond to finish the game. Also the borrowed scorebook should be returned ot the check-out window, so that the results may be published in the Exponent. The trophy fee, which is payable now, amounts to $16 for all fraternities that have a membership, including pledges, of 31 or more men. A $10 assessment is required of fraternities with a membership of fewer than 31 men.
Athletic Booster Organizations Set Forth Purdue Sportsman's Creed Sponsored by Reamer and Gimlet Clubs, Gold Peppers, and P. A. A., Purdue’s sportsmanship creed is set forth as a model for all University students, both old and new. These organizations hope that all Boilermaker sports fans will abide by all ten points in the creed. The true Boilermaker sportsman believes: That all athletic opponents are guests and should be treated with the courtesy due from Purdue as a host. ^ That all decisions of officials should be accepted without question. That players or officials should never be hissed or booed. * That abusive or irritating language from the sidelines is the mark of a poor sportsman. That applause is due opponents who make good plays or show good sportsmanship. That no attempt should be made to rattle an opposing player, such as the man attempting a free throw in basketball or the pitcher in baseball. That the “game” should be won by fair and lawful means, abiding at all times by the real spirit of the rules. That the “game” should be loved for its own sake and not for what victory may bring. That “games” should be “won without boasting and lost without excuses”. That “win or lose”, Purdue’s teams deserve wholehearted support.
Gimlet Club Sponsors Direct Reports Of Gomes For First Time; Issue Sports Leaflet Purdue radio station WBAA will broadcast (every football and basketball game which the Boilermakers play this year whether at home or away.

Included on these broadcasts will be reports from scouts giving some information of systems, plays, and personnel of the future opponents of the Gold and Black.
Early Freshman Impressed By University Spirit
“My first impression of Purdue is definitely favorable. I have been on the campuses of several universities and never have found one so completely to my liking.” This is the impression of Bob Ronksley, first freshman on the campus, from Wheeling, West Virginia. Bob, who is 18 years old, graduated from Triadelphia high school in Wheeling, and is planning to enter the school of Civil Engineering. Purdue was his choice because of its national reputation for engineering. Impressed by Spirit When questioned as to what impressed him most the first few days. Bob said the friendly spirit prevailing throughout the campus and buildings that are modern and yet seem to meet the requirements of a large school, stood out in his mind. In addition to engineering he is interested in both debating and radio work, and expects to make one of these his activity. Bob is anxious for school to start, for he feels that the new experience of going to school in a large imiversity will be very different from anything he has had ^ part in before. In angering a question about the Freshman handbook. Bob said he thought it is the “Best possible means for giving freshmen the information they should know to get an adequate start in the University.”
Clevett Issues First Call For Intramural Athletic Managers
With the approach of the opening contests of the Ward intramural program, “Chief” Clevett, in charge of recreational activities, has asked that all sophomores, juniors, and seniors who are interested in being Ward managers to contact him immediately. Although upperclassmen are preferred, any freshman who has the experience and ability to manage intramural teams is also
asked to report to Clevett. Fifteen managers will be needed;
one for each of the 15 wards into which West Lafayette is divided by
the intramural office.
These managers will be in complete charge of the intramural activities of the ward. Each manager will be in charge of all teams from his ward and it will be his duty to notify all members of the time and place of all contests. He will also handle all business matters that pertain to his ward and the intramural office. His job will cover all sports and last throughout the year. Several students are also needed to work as ward intramural managers. They will work in the Fieldhouse office afternoons, and will be in charge of recording scores and
keeping records.
Awards for all ward managers will be in the form of decorative keys. The outstanding ward intramural manager will receive a sweater and his numerals at the end of
his sophomore year.
Juniors Spend Two Weeks At Fort Knox Military camp for junior military students opened at Fort Knox Sunday, July 16. A few fellows reported as early as Thursday, but lepented as they were put on KP duty to earn their board. Sunday was spent in drawing out equipment and having physical examinations. “Hilly” Kashner, six foot eight junior civil, gave the quartermaster men a headache. He
took a 14EE shoe.
Rain, Rain
The six weeks at camp were spent sleeping in tents. And for the first two weeks there was an abimdance of rain. Running around in wet clothing became tiresome. The first ^week-end the boys forgot their range, sights, and deflections and went into Louisville for a dance at the Brown Hotel. Dates were arranged for, and the gals’ mothers brought them and took them home. By the second week of camp “lip spinach” was being worn by many of the Purdue ROTC men. Jimmy Hoffman was the first battery commander to get his guns lost. Bfis corporal sent the guns down the wrong fork of a road and they were stuck in the mud for an hour. Quiet Fourth The Fourth of July isn’t celebrated as one might expect it would be at a military camp. Fireworks are restricted to one sxMt. During the week of the Fourth a special mechanized cavalry exhibition was put on for the Brazilian Chief of Staff who visited the camp. Men seemed more than glad to get their pay envelopes Saturday morning, July 29, and return to civilization as citizens once more. The week-end before pay day'was spent in an overnight trip to Mammoth in an overnight trip to Monmoth cave as a tactical problem.THE PURDUE EXPONENT
