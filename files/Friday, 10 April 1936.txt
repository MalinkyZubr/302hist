H. L Hersh Named Head Of PIA For Next Year Buxtonf Kelly Elected To Other Major Offices in Heavy Vote; Dance Date Changed Herman 1. Hersh, a junior in the school of chemical engineering, was elected president of the Purdue Independent Association for the coming year from a field of four candidates Wednesday. Approximately 350 of the 700 P. I. A. members went to the polls to cast ballots in the heaviest voting in
the history of the organization. Loran 0. Huxton, a junior in the ag school, was elected vice president, and Regina Kelly, junior home economics student, was named co-ed
executive.
other elected officers included Mary Wien, home economics freshman, secretary; and J. E. Ward, junior electrical, treasurer. One Clique Wins The election, climaxing one of the most interesting and closely contested campaigns ever staged for control of the P. I. A., resulted in almost a clean sweep for one political clique. Ward being the only outside candidate elected. As was generally understood before the election, all the other successful candidates were members df the
same group.
As a result of the congestion on the University social calendar caused by a change in the date of the Junior Prom, the time of the P. I. A. Spring Formal has been changed to next Friday evening, April 17. The affair originally was scheduled for May 8. P. I. A. offi'cers last night were unable to provide additional information about the dance. Work on decorations will start at once and the band will be announced early next week.

University Military Band To Parade At Kentucky Derby Festival April 29 Arrangements have just been completed for the University’s wellknown Military Band to appear in the Kentucky Derby Festival Day Parade again this year. The date is April 29. Last spring the band made its first appearance in Louisville at the festival, and won a loving cup offered for the “Best College Band in the Parade”. It was on this occa-
sion that the band used for the first time the small electric lights which attracted so much attention at the Northwestern night game
last October.
The band made such a good impression on the managers of the Festival Day parade last year that they determined to make the trip very attractive for the University Band this year. As a result the band will travel to Louisville on a special train, and will be given tickets to the Churchill Downs clubhouse during the afternoon so that they may see the races. After the races, band members will be entertained at a dinner in the Kentucky hotel by Purdue Alumni. The day will be concluded with the mammoth parade of col-
lege bands.
Chicago Dads Organize One hundred and twenty-five University dads, prospective dads, and prospective students completed the organization of a Chicago Dads chapter at a dinner meeting at Henrici’s in Chicago, Tuesday evening.

Kizer, athletic director and head football coach, were the speakers of the evening. Prof. Robert Phillips, adviser to the Purdue Dads Associa tion, represented the University. Voting to hold two meetings annually, one in the spring and one in the fall, the Chicago organization elected John W. Favorite, LaGrange, 111., chairman, and John D. Clancy, vice chairman. The policies of the new organization will be controlled by an executive board of 16 members.

Dr.W.K.Batt
Addresses Engineers -
Minimum Essentials Stressed In Talk Be-
fore Upperclassmen
Speaking to the junior and senior Engineers in Fowler Hall, Dr. W. L. Batt, president of SKP Industries and University graduate, stressed the requisites of public speaking, ability to express one’^s self, and the ability to sell one’s self to the employer as those essentials to be acquired while at col-
lege.
Dr. Batt told assembled engineers, “Be sure to know something of the company with which you are trying to get a job”. Persistency on the part of the job-seeking engineer IS another of the requisites for success. Other Advantages Joining and keeping membership in the student branch of student engineering societies offers benefits in the contacts with older, experienced engineers and also furnishes a background for the engineer wanting recognition in his chosen field, the speaker pointed out.

Life Savers To Take Tests R. V. Benson, RedCross Representative, To Lead Instruction '/ Students and townspeople anxious to qualify for the examiners’ rating as Red Cross life savers will be given the opportunity all next week in the Memorial Gymnasium pool at the University with Roy V. Benson, life saving representative of the American Red Cross, directing the instruction. In addition to instruction and testing those candidates who are qualifying for the rating for the first time, Benson will demonstrate new methods for those in this vicinity who have already qualified, and are anxious to brush up on their work. Begin Monday Benson will launch the instructional work on Monday afternoon and it will continue through next Friday. Benson, who had thirteen years’ experience in life saving and water safety work previously, became field representative for the life saving service of the Red Cross in July last year. He was given the life saving examiners’ rating in 1923, and became a special examiner in 1929, devoting his time to the training of other Red Cross^ Life Saving Examiners. From 1931 to 1934, Benson was an itinerant life saving representative, visiting Red Cross chapters to inaugurate and conduct life saving programs. He also taught swimming in various public and parochial schols in Rochester, N. Y. Last summer he instructed life saving examiners who upon qualification taught water rescue and safety to CCC enrolees. Last fall he assist|ld with the Red Cross highway emergency first aid program, working with chapters to select suitable sites for hig'hway first aid stations.

en Ward, charming songstress Whose renditions with Goodman’s band have gained wide prominence. The band will complete an engagement at the Congress Hotel in Chicago on April 30 and vnll play its first road engagement at the Prom. Goodman then will make a limited tour of the country before returning to New York, playing at the Indiana Junior Prom on May 8. Debut Goodman, who made his debut as a baton master about a year ago, almost instantly was accorded national acclaim for his distinctive style of “swing” rhythms. In addition to the commercial NBC radio programs, the orchestra has played at leading Eastern and Mid-West-ern hotels and night clubs since its organization, and has made numerous recordings. Collegiate affairs are likewise no novelty to the youthful maestro, who recently has played for many dances at the nation’s leading colleges. The tour which he will start May 1 also includes dances at several colleges and universities. Personnel The orchestra personnrf is composed of veterans^the samVorganization which made its debut about a year ago. Goodman himself is an accomplished clarinetist and will participate in several novelty numbers presented by the band. In addition to Miss Ward, other vocalists include “Toots” Mondello and Gene Kruppa. The committee last night announced that^ the Prom will be strictly formal, stating that the general consensus of student opinion seemed to favor that course. After changing the date for the affair, members of the committee interviewed many students to determine whether they favored making the Prom a spring formal. Most of those questioned favored the traditional formal attire as a means to prevent so much variation in dress at the dance. Decorations and other plans for the Prom were reported last night as progressing favorably. Other announcements are expected early next week.

After yesterday’s red splurge, trying to settle down to a normal existence is like an uneasy calm after a cyclone.
Members of |;he graduating class in the school of agriculture, members of the faculty, and alumni attended the ninth annual banquet of the Indiana Ag Alumni Association recently. Since its origin, the affair has proved to be increasingly popular, especially from the standpoint of promoting a spirit of friendship between instructors and graduating seniors. The success of the banquet has been largely due to the efforts and cooperation of the members of the faculty.
m one evening, the banquet serves as a sort of climax to an extensive program, sponsored by the ag faculty, of promoting amiable

same opportunity for alumni associations that is found in the ag school because of the fact that most of the ag alumni reside in the state after graduation; however, since most of the student-faculty social affairs that are held on the campus are made possible through the efforts of the faculty, the other schools should not be considered as severely handicapped. The program that is practiced on the south campus is one worthy of the attention of the personnel of the other schools. Oftentimes at such gatherings as that held Monday night for the ag seniors, students learn to appreciate qualities in their instructors and instructors find qualities in the students that are not noticed in the classroom.—G.

PIA, ‘‘Calendaritis” To the Editor:
subjected to unfair criticism by someone who has a grudge against the organization or perhaps is uninformed of both
outside comments need not be answered as they are obvious for what they are. However, this week a situation has arisen concerning the affairs of P. I. A. which I believe should not be overlooked. This year the Purdue Independent Association has a membership of nearly seven hundred. Even though occasionally there is this adverse criticism, the organization attempts to serve its members in every way, and what is more, a good majority does benefit in more ways than one. The service rendered by P. I, A. which affects the greatest number of members is the offering of three large dances each year. This includes a Spring Formal Dance and is intended to be tbe most important of the three. At the beginning of last semester when the dates for dances were distributed to the various organizations, P. I. A. received May 8 for their Sprmg Formal. TOs dance has been continuously advertised for this date even to the present, and However, .1. A
ing anyone the date has been changed to May 1. With the announcement that the Junior Prom is to be held May 1, the P. L A. is offered for their Spring Formal Dance, April 17, one week from today. We may have one week to choose the orchestra, prepare decorations, select chaperones, and make arrangements for imports for our most important dance of tbe yea^. Besides, is the middle of April a fitting date for a Spring Formal? The original date. May 8, has been arranged for the 4-H Club Roundup. It is my impression that the Memorial Union Building was originally intended fpr the use of Purdue students. Judi^hg from past experience more than 400 couples have planned to attend. What explanation should tbe P. I. A. social chairman give to these 800 people, most of whom are Purdue students,.who have been disappointed? Or is that the duty of the chairman? Instead, what explanation will those

Striving to overcome a weakness at the plate, the emphasis of practice yesterday was placed on batting drill, and Lambert is hopeful that the nine may show more in the way of an attack against the Bulldogs than it has so far this season.

“Cookery is an art upon which so much of our daily corn-
ed in Edinburgh, Scotland, almost 100 years ago. Although its pages are yellow and stained and the title, “Cookery and '©omestic Economy for Young Housewives, Including Directions for Servants”, is barely distinguishable, it is really a fascinating little work. According to this book, “a ypung and thriftily d^ housewife will, if possible^ proceed to market hers^f, in otder to lay in butcher^eat and other fresh provisions fOr her fam--^ ily.” Todays as in 1845, when the book was written, the standard of Selection, the principles of buying arid the aims Of cooking are of the highest. Our great-grandmothers purchased nieat ri little differently than we dp today, but they looked for the samemarks of quality. “The best meat is mat,Which is moderately fat. If It be lean, or almost free of fat, it is an indication that the animal, was ill-fed, and that the mea,t will prove tough and ■ tasteless.”' > ' ^: In this little book are instructions for choosing vegetables arid other foods, and for selecting kitchen equipment. Directions for serving potatoes say to ‘‘peel them and place theiri in a dish with a napkin over them.” Salads as we know them today are practically limitless in scope. A hundred years ago they were defined as “a general name for certain vegetables prepared so as to be served and eaten raw.” This confined them to a few of the greens, radishes, celery, arid young onioris. What a world of pies and tarts w'e now have at our disposal. When this book was written there were but two kinds—“meat pies and fruit pies or tarts.” Now we seldom see meat pies and the fruit variety has changed immeasurably. Although some of the instructions inclosed in this little book seem trivial and matter-of-fact, there is a lot of good thought back of them, and many serve as a basis for the cooking principles in use today.

“Hamburgers! Ten Cents! Have a hot hamburger,” cries a boy at the circus, the football game or traveling lunch stand. So the consumer 3uys the sandwich, but what does the meat do to his stomach? Hamburger and the sulfite, which preserves it, “are one of the severest of digestive and kidney hazafdsy’’say A. Kaliet Anri Pv fe book “100,000,000 Guiriea Pigs*’. In
Prof. Robert Phillips, adviser of f^e Purdue Dads’ Association, announced yesterday that the Indianapolis chapter of the University Dads will complete its organization at a dinner meeting Mpnday^night at 6:30 o’clock in the Columbia club in Indianapolis. Pres. E. C. Elliott and Robert C. Puller, Student Union president, have been chosen as the principal speakers. The University choir, under the direction of A. P. Stewart, will present a special program of music. . Toastmaster Toastmaster for the evening will be Walter Krull, past-president of the University Alumni Association, who has been acting as temporary chairman of the organization. A short business session will be held for the purpose of selecting the permanent officers of the organization.
this book the authors describe the hamburger sold for large profit as fit for the garbage can in" most cases father than a human digestive tract, To the habitual “pop” or “coke” drinkers, 100,000,060. Gnihea Pigs points put that 12 out of 18 soft drinks are adidterated and also are very high in bacterial content-^ showing ah improper sterilization of bottles. Artificial Preservation In dried fruits over five times as much sulfur dioxide as is prescribed by law is sprayed on apricots to preserve the color. and to increase the sales of the fruit. To conceal green tomatoes and overripe tomatoes artificial dyestuffs are used in canning to make the fruit appear red. One of the first foods to be adulterated was honey. Since sugar syrup, glucose, and other sweets were added to honey, the honest bee-keeper w;as put out of business. The present Pood and Drugs Act, which was passed in 1906, destroyed honey adulteration almost entirely. Only twenty cases have been cited since 1906, nineteen of
which occurred before 1920^ This knowledge of afiuKeration heed not depress the reader, for definite steps have keen taken to-r •ward protecting the consumer.; The American Medical Associatibh has appointed, a special committee, that examines foods; and isshes a certificate of approval if ( the Substance meets with stahdards. This ^oup of men tests the labeled foods as to purity and relation of package contents to the label and also scrutinizes advertising claims. If a certificate of approval is given, the committee tests the products, continually to maintain the high standard and censors the advertising copy at different times. Committee Work Work of this committee on malted milks prevent the advertiser from flaunting any magic cure-all or sleep-inducing claims before the eyes of the public. On the label should be printed the ingredients in orddr of their importance. What this country needs is a modern Pure Pood and Drugs Act, which leaves no loop holes for wily manufacturers, for “national health means national wealth”.

Fraternities, Sororities Start Spring Gleaning
K^ainti^g, cleaning up, and g^eral reconditioning seems to be the order of the day for a number of the fraternities and sororities on the campus have already begun to freshen up their houses and grounds. The importance of neatness and good appearance is not appreciated by some of the organizations and townspeople to the fullest extent. The Greek men and women especially need to put up a good appearance, not only to appear attractive to parents and rushees, but also to live up to their obligations as integral parts of the University. Toning-Up Needed Uav^^^ at^ tention during the spring. Many must be eirtirely re-sCede and appUcatibhs ; 6f proper fertilizers woiild- aid them all^ v Cement and stone walks need patcjdng’ up
retouching, while hedges and plants trimming and other attentions to make them look their best for the next few months. Spring is also the season for painting, which is badly needed by numerous residences, fraternity and sorority houses. Expert advice is readily available on the subject and should be consulted if the best effects are to be obtained. Several houses are also receiving new> roofing while the installation'of insulation materials is preparing others for the hottest summer: day and will also be of value during the winter months. Coincident with the government offers of assistance in repairing and building homes and Greek organizations’ houses, prices of builds ing mUteriafej paints hni^ lai^caping necessities are at such a low level so to be available to 'even the humblest hoihe-ownt^. ^
