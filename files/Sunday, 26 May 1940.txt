A Week of War
By J. H. McKee -
The Battle For Control Of The English Channel ... is rapidly reaching a climax, as Allied armies fight to break out a trap threatening the destruction of sections of the British, P^ench, and Belgian armies. It is estimated that nearly |R million troops are trapped in the Nazi ring of steel around northern France. German military officials claim that Boulogne is in their hands and that Calais, just twenty-two miles from the British coast, will fall at any moment. Paris announced yesterday that fifteen French generals had been discarded, and five hundred suspected foreigners had been arrested at the order of General Weygand.
The Entry Of Spain
... and Italy into the war on the side of the Germans seems nearer at the end of this week than it has at any time during the present war. In Rome, Corsicans demonstrated, demanding the return to Italy of Corsica, now in French hands. Sir Samual Hoare, former member of the Chamberlain cabinet, was sent to Madrid as British ambassador, in an effort to check any growth of Spanish pro-German feeling. With German Troops
. . . but tWenty-two miles from British shores, King George VI called upon the people of the British Isles to stand off the German attack on the British Empire. “It is no mere territorial conquest that our enemies are seeking, but it is the overthrow of this empire and everything fpr which it stands, and after that a conquest of the world,” the King said. “Defeat will not mean some brief eclipse from which we shall emerge with strength renewed. It will mean the destruction of our world as we have known it. “With God’s help we shall not
fail,” he concluded.
In A Short Ten Minute . . . speech to the world last Sunday Winston Churchill described the situation in France as “extremely dangerous” for both sides, and predicted that after the French invasion Germany would turn to the British Isles. He declared that success for the Allies will come “only after a furious and relentless assault” on the German position. He reported that the Royal Air Force was “striking mightily” at the source of the German mechanized power, their gasoline supply. It was Churchill’s first speech to the British people since he became prime minister. (Continued on page 2)

Army Of "Little Men" In Chem Annex Exhibit Marches Aimlessly On And On By Lee Rnffner — "
For a long time we’ve been wondering where all of those “little men” that seem to have crept into the conversation of a number of our friends; in fact we were skeptical enough to have a slight doubt as to their actual existence. We found them, though—almost ran into them, literally speaking—one day when we came around the comer on the first fioor of the Chemistry annex. There they were, no less than 80 of them, merrily smiling at us
Marching Men
At first we thought mayb should get our glasses change^ we looked again and they were there, at least that’s what
thought ’til we looked a little closer Then we saw that the first 80Jhad marched away and 80 mo^e^had taken their place. Our mriosity aroused, we made a closer inspection and found that theyNweren’t real men at all, but little fellows made by ^ mounting a head,Varms, and legs on medium sized b^les. Each bottle contained one ofj^ese organic chemistry nightmares like propronohydroxamic acid or hydroxylammonium acid sulphate, each of the boys carried a little card like kids in a kindergarten with his name on it to prove who he was. They we^e all mounted in a large display case in six groups and on revolving tracks like ducks in a shoot(ing gallery—only no one was shooting at them. Like those futile ducks they just kept marching and marching, appearing and disappear-
ing, but getting nowhere.
200 Couples Attend. Airport Dance; Hear Doolittle At Banquet BULLETIN At eleven o’clock last night, a committee composed of Flying and Glider club officers chose Miss Virginia Ann Mueller, United Air Lines stewardess, and speaker at the pre-dance banquet, as 1940 Queen of Aviation.
Emrick, Murphy To Receive Leather. Best Teacher Medals
Despite the inclement weather, over 200 couples danced to the music of Irvan Maury and their band last night at the annual airport dance in the hanger of the University airport. Preceding the dance, members of the Flying and Glider clubs, their dates, and guests of the club attended a banquet held in room 363 of the Union. Doolittle Speaks Major James H. Doolittle, aviation director of Shell oil, fiew in from St. Louis yesterday afternoon to speak at the banquet on “Blind Flying” and to attend the week-end of air festivities at the University. Bill Greve, member of the Flying club, acted as toastmaster and introduced Doolittle. Other notables at the banquet were: Nadine Mueller, United Airline stewardess, who told of her experiences as a transport hostess; Lt. Mike Murphy, famous stunt flyer, who spoke on “Stunt Plying”; Major Charles E. Cox, supervisor of private fiying development of the Third region; and Captain Harold Neeley, district superintendent of CAA. Air-Minded Decorations The decorations at the dance refiected the Spirit of Aviation. Four airplanes ready for the take-off were placed in the corners of the hanger. Two air pylons—similar to those seen at air races—occupied the center of the fioor. The Loening trophy, presented to the Purdue Plying Club at the National Intercollegiate Plying Conference last March in Washington, D. C., was on display in the hanger. This trophy was awarded to the club by Grover Loening, president and chief aircraft designer of the Loening Aircraft Company.
Band Leader Climaxes 30 Years Of Service; Historian Honored Prof. P. S. Emrick, director of Purdue military bands, was named last night for the annual Leather Medal Award presented by the local chapter of Sigma Delta Chi, national professional journalistic fraternity. Prof. Charles B. Murphy of the history department was at the same time named recipient of the Best Teacher Medalion, which is being given this year for the third time.

Purdue Wins Last Game Thrills At Airport Today
Of Baseball Season, 18-6
The whole display looked pretty good to us, but we wondered what it was doing there since a sign at the back of the case said COMMERCIAL SOLVENTS CORPORATION in very large and very plain letters. We talked to Elizabeth Riley of the chemistry department about it and found that the display had first been shown by Commercial Solvents at the Exposition of Chemical Industries held recently in New York City and had cost them a neat ^^fivethousand dollars to put together in the first place. The display is now the permanent property of the Uni-
versity.
■\Ve then consulted Dr. Hass, head of the chemistry department, on the subject and it developed that there was a total of 163 of the boys, but that they were only a small part of the whole family because they had about 560 brothers that they had to leave home. All of the compounds that they represented were made by a nitration process that had been developed by the Purdue Research Foundation in a r^ search that has been carried on here since 1930. Commercial Production Commercial production on 12 of them started a week ago Tuesday, Doc told us, and it is expected that the number will be doubled before the year is out. He seemed rather happy about the whole thing, and why not ? He’s a kind of stepfather to all the little fellows and who wouldn’t be proud of seven hundred step-children ?
Purdue’s erratic baseball season was brought to a more erratic close yesterday on the Ross-Ade recreation field with the Boilermakers defeating Illinois Wesleyan 18-6 in nine innings of cold driving rain and mist. Shakespeare’s Comedy of Erors is a piker compared to yesterday’s fracas up behind the Fieldhouse. It required three-and-a-half hours to play the game and P. T. Bamum, Jr., if present, got an eye-ful of ideas
for the coming circus season. Bailey was the starting Boilermaker hurler but couldn’t find the plate, walking eight men in the two innings he worked. The Illini got a couple of hits off Bob’s tosses and led 5-3 before Mr. Bailey left for the warm water in the Field-
house basement. One Big Inning
Trailing 6-3 as the result of Bailey’s wildness, due to a very slippery ball from the precipitation, Purdue entered the third so determined to down the visitors that Dutch’s men had six men across the plate and a 9-6 margin before their side was retired. Hearne was hit by a pitched ball to start the rally, Stamm followed by walking, as did Smithson. With the bases full, John Vernon slathmed out a long triple into deep left field, evacuating the bases. Emmert, who had relieved Bailey, walked and Fisher hit a home run, his first of two, to ttie center field fence, and Pur-
due had six runs. Here Comes Rain
At the end of the fourth, rain began to fall so hard that Umpire *Willis called the game, but as the field remained fairly dry, Fehring demanded that the game continue i—and it did, to the wails of the Illini who aren’t used to playing for keeps, but just for fun.
Lieutenant Mike Murphy, famous stunt flyer, and Earl Stein, parachute king, will headline a cast of famous performers today lin the thrill-a-minute air show sponsored by Captain L. I.
Aretz, manager of the University airport.
Starting with a model airplane ____________________________
We Love Rain
Purdue’s offense kept right on clicking as the rain increased and the Illini, endeavoring to console themselves for having to play in the rain, and trying to play at the same time, were easy victims of a Boilermaker plate attack that sent base hits through, over, and be-
tween the infielders.
The hitting for the day was highlighted by the Boilermaker catch-

For 34 Years ... Paul Spotts Emrick has been connected with Purdue University, He entered the University in 1904 and graduated in 1908. He returned to the University two years later and has been here ever since. Until three years ago Emrick, who is better known as the director of the military band, was assistant professor in the school of electrical engineering. In his senior year on the campus, Spotts was influential in starting Company E 1, local Scabbard and Blade unit. He himself now hol^the rank of major in the reserve army. But at no time since he has been at the University has he been separated from the band. In all these years Emrick has never failed to develop bands that have set the pace for military as well as collegiate bands throughout the country. It was he who first introduced letter Iformations m 1910 and it was also Emrick who introduced illuminated marching. His dream since coming to the University has been suitable quarters for the band. This year with the completion of the Music Hall, his dream has been realized, for it was at his insistence and careful planning that the band was provided with modern, spacious quarters in the new building. To the men in the band, Emrick is nothing short of a hero. He is a keen disciplinarian but has the admiration of his of ^officers and men. To the students and public at large he is a master of military music and formations and one of Purdue’s best salesmen. Truly, he has contributed “to the welfare, success, and reputation of Purdue University.” "To Be A Good Teacher . . . one must live his subject; it must be his whole life,” says Charles Beckman Murphy, recipient of Sigma Delta Chi’s 1940 Best Teacher award. Probably trying to live up to this idea is what has made Charley a “best teacher,” for certainly he has lived his subject. i Since 1927, when he first taught history at Purdue, he has directed his reading, summer travels, conversation, really his life toward making himself a better and more useful disseminator of historic facts. , Charley came first to Purdue in 1922 as a freshman in the School of Science. Both his mother and father were graduates of the University. With an eye on a newspaper career, he spent most of his time in University Hall, studying English. But his background as the son of a state political leader made history and government a natural second. Dr. Thomas Moran, former head of the history department here at Purdue, once said that Charley was the best history student that he had in his 32 years of teaching. And so at graduation he went to the University of Chicago to complete his work. By the following fall he had his master’s degree in history, with a major in Southern history. “My liking for southern history possibly came from grade school where I enjoyed taking exception to the stories told of the Civil War by my school teachers.” And at that early age Charley was a omnivorous reader, as'*^ he is today, Reading is a habit which he tries to build into all his students, with the desire to find out more than is in the text book about the subject under discussion. At present his is busy collecting his vast store of southern history into a history of the South. “But so far I haven’t been 'able to get the whole picture of the South to suit myself,” he says. At his home in Brookston, Indiana, he could show you a stack of paper on which are recorded the numerous human interest stories he has collected about the South. Some day, when he feels that he is able to see the South in the proper perspective, he will put these stories into a completed text. Professor Murphy enjoys telling his stories to the class and watching their reactions. After two or three semesters he tries »to substitute different stories. It is his desire not to become stereotyped, and certainly he is not. —J. H. McK. WRH Residents Will Honor Dr. M. G. Mellon
A Week or War (Continued from page 1) To Meet The "Grave . . . peril m which the nation stands” Britain became a virtual dictator nation last week. The Parliament gave to the government full dictatorial powers over men and material resources. Without hesitation both houses of the parliament passed the measure. Major Clement Attlee, a member of the Churchill cabinet, said before the /House of Commons that the measures were passed “to mobilize the effective resources of the nation, and to meet the grave situation in which the country stood.” In An Attempt' To . . . halt possible “fifth column” activities in the British Isles, Britain’s Scotland Yard ari'ested Sir Oswald Mosley and other leading membeis of Mosley’s fascist “British Ordei” last week. Mosley was suspected of being the would-be “fuehler” of England. In An Exchange ... of diplomatic notes between Biitish Prime Minister Winston Churchill and Italian Piemiei Benito Mussolini, Churchill was told by the premier that Italy’s pro-Ger-man bias was well known in Allied elides, and in the near future the country’s non-belligerent attitude might have to be changed. Fascist news agencies indicated that the country might soon have ->to show active participation with Geimany with tioops, but Mussolini has made no suggestion of this final decision.

Lowdermilk Tells Of Conservation In Foreign Lands “Soil and Civilization was the topic of a speech delivered by Dr. W. C. Lowdermilk at an open meeting of Ceres, agricultural honorary, and the Soil Science Society of Indiana, Friday night at 7:30 p.m. in the Electrical Engineering building. The lecture was illustrated with slides, excerpts from pictures taken by Dr. Lowdermilk on a recent tour of the Old World. In his tour Dr. Lowdermilk traveled 30,000 miles by train, automobile, airplane and afoot in 17 countries, including England, France, Italy, Egypt, Algiers, Palestine and others. Erosion Survey Dr. Lowdermilk was appointed by the Department of Agriculture to make a survey of soil erosion, soil and water conservation, and torrential flood control in the Old World. It was an attempt by the Department of Agriculture to learn new methods of soil conservation and to devise means by which erosion could be dealt with more effectively. Results of Lowdermilk’s survey have produced convincing evidence |>f the need m this country for bringing to bear all available resourcefulness and ingenuity in the solution of this problem while great aieas of good land still lemain. Neglect By Man He illustrated m his talk how neglect by man and the lavages of nature have combined forces in devastating great areas of once fruitful lands, in foreign countiues, and then he showed how these conditions could have been remedied if not caught too late. He also warned that the same condition of total rum and desolation is taking form m this country because of neglect and misuse of lands and forest

Freshmen Nine Meets Varsity In Final Tilt Of Practice Series As an aftermath of the regular baseball season, the first string freshmen nine will meet a sophomore - junior varsity combination tomorrow at four on Ross-Ade field. This clash will present diamond fans a preview of next season's prospects. This will be the third meeting of the squads, the varsity having won both of the previous contests, 1810 and 9-8. In the two tilts the varsity has only outhit the rhinies by one hit; however, the rhinie fielding is not up to the varsity’s caliber. Most promising among the frosh ^are Crumley, Carson, McCaffery, and t'razier. Janisch Starts Starting pitcher for the freshmen will be John Janisch, who al'lowed the varsity only seven hits and struck out eight in the six innings he worked in the first game. Also on the frosh pitching roster is Rarick who only gave up one hit in the three innings he hurled, but it was the winning blow. The probable line-up for the game is as follows: Varsity Freshmen McFerren, 2b Carson, If Rawles, 3b Frazier, rf Mitchell, If McCaffery, 3b Doherty, c Crumley, lb Waterhouse, rf Cook, 2b Fisher, c Meyers, ss Ridgway, lb Daniels, cf Correll, ss Smith, c Bailey, p Janisch, p SCA . . . held its last dance of the semester in the East and West Facul1|y Lounges.

Notre Dame Takes State Tennis Crown; Canale Wins Singles, Aids In Duo Victory i/ Last Thursday the Notre Dame tennis team descended upon the Boilermaker campus to play in the Indiana Intercollegiate championships. Leaving yesterday, they romped off with all the laurels. The Irish not only clinched the singles and doubles but also the team title by amassing 21 Jioints, almost twice the Riveter's total of 11, which was second to the Ramblers. In the singles, Dan Canale, Notre
Dame’s sophomore sensational star captured the title by downing Don Maris of Earlham, and a half hour later he paired with Bill Fay, last year’s single champ, to clinch the doubles crown by beating another Irish combination of Joyce and Bowler. Canale Coasts Finishing in a drizzling rain Dan Canale won the singles crown in straight sets by defeating Don Maris, 6-1, 6-1, 6-1. Calm and collected, Canale never was in trouble as he defeated his rival very easily. This ends the collegiate season of Canale who is undefeated this spring. The Irish ace had won over a field of such outstanding players as Captain Fay of Notre Dame, last year’s winner; John Joyce, runner-up last year; Don Maris of Earlham, present runner-up, and Captain Fuente of the Riveters. A change in courts didn’t affect Canale’s ability, as the matches were transferred to the Fieldhouse. Teaming with Pay, they downed the duo of Joyce and Bowler, 6-4, 6-2, 6-3. They won out of a field of such great stars as Hanna and Souder, the pre-tournament favorites; Fuente and Hebbeler, the Riveter number one pair, and Joyce and Bowler. Their victims were Peters and Scully of Manchester, Anderson and Lucht of the Riveter squad, and Reich and Spear of DePauw. Start Fast By losing only two singles matches in the preliminary rounds, the Irish built up a team lead that no school was able to overcome. After the prelims the match

looked like an Iriph intramural meet as they had four of the eight singles contestants and three of the eight doubles. Trailing Notre Dame by ten counters in the team race were the Boilermakers, and the Ifiird spot was Captured by DePauw with seven. Earlham was fourth With five'^points. Butler and St. Joseph garnered one each. After the matches, awards were given to the four finalists and the two top teams. Notre Dame was presentedfwith four of the six medals, Regular intercollegiate medals and trophies were presented. Each winner in the singles and the doubles received a gold medal while the runnerup was presented with a silver one. Trophies were given to the winning school and the runnerup, which were Notre Dame and the Boilermakers, respectively. Riveters Entertain State Track Teams Host to the Indiana state track championships for the first time in four years, the Boilermaker cinder squad will attempt to not only entertain the representatives of the near-dozen colleges entered, but play havoc with the Notre DameIndiana coalition. The annual affair is scheduled for Ross-Ade stadium next Saturday. For several years Indiana, Notre Dame and Purdue have been closely matched in the struggle for the Hoosier track supremacy. Of late the Indiana squad has been showing the way, but the Boilermakers and Irish have constantly threatened. This year a vastly-improved Riveter squad, one that shows greater team balance, will pit its budding stars against the rest of the state colleges, hoping to disintegrate all predictions which favor the Indiana squad.

They play anyway, and do their opponents ever cry about it! —I-I— Yesterday’s contest on Ross-Ade recreational field was the last for the Boilermaker baseball squad for this season and probably the last time Purdue will ever play Illinois Wesleyan here. Goodness, but those athletes were sore, and I do mean mad. —I-I— Purdue was jolly well trimming the visitor club when all the rain saved up for a couple of weeks was emptied onto the playing field, and the game was called to a halt. But have you ever seen a real Dutchman’s determination ? If you haven’t you could have witnessed a genuine example, as Mr. Fehring, who coaches the Gold and Black team said, “Oh yes, we are going to play.” The game was continued. —M— Everything, including league of nations diplomacy, was used to talk Dutch out of five more innings, but I now doubt if Dutch could have been talked into having that contest called a “no game” if hell and high (and even higher) water had broken loose, —I-I— During those last five innings'of playing in wet weather, I sat on the mini bench and talked with the lads of that school. Those kids play ball for keeps, but not in the rain. Almost all of them are the property of some major league team, and four of them played in England last summer with the American intercollegiate team that visited Europe. —y— School will be out for those boys from Illinois Wesleyan this Friday, but then their season just starts. They took an intensive baseball tour during the spring vacation through Texas and Arizona, bu^next week after school they will go through the Ivy League in the East. —I-I— They are so good that they’ve been invited to play for the commencement series with the Yale nine at New Haven, Conn. From there they take up battles with Cornell, Princeton, Dartmouth, and Colgate. And do those boys know the records! I mentioned something about a certain major leaguer’s average of the
Michigan Wins Big Ten Track Title; Purdue Sixth \ Chicago, 111. (Special) May 25—^Michigan's powerful and well balanced track squad gained its fourth straight Big Ten outdoor championship this afternoon at Northwestern's Dyche stadium. Scoring a total of 51 points, the Wolverine machine easily captured first place over the runner-up, Indiana, who counted 35 1-2 points. Purdue scored 22 points, placing sixth. Ed Holderman, Boilermaker dis-
tance star, paced the field ta the tape in the two mile run, being clocked at 9:17.1 minutes. Michigan’s great two-miler, Capt. Schwartzkopf, was unable to compete in the event. In addition to his performance in the two mile, aii event in which he ordinarily doesn’t compete, Holderman placed second in the mile run, trailing Indiana’s Kane to the tape by several yards. The time for Kane’s mile was 4:15 minutes. 'Weber Second Jake Weber, giant Boilermaker, finished second to Indiana’s Harris in the shot put after heaving the 16-lb. ball farther than anyone in Friday’s preliminaries. Harris, who set the only new record of the meet
—166 feet, 5% inches, for the discus, won his first in the shot put on a 51% foot toss, being the lone double-winner of the day. Football captain-elect Dave Rankin finished second behind Kelly, a Wolverine in the 220 low hurdles. Kelly’s time of :25.8 was .3 seconds slower than Rankin’s preliminary time. Broad jumper Ted Tycocki added a third to the Boilermaker total. He was topped by Hodgson, of Minnesota and Lewis of Illinois. Scores of the teams are as follows: Michigan, 51; Indiana, 35%; Wisconsin, 26%; Minnesota, 25; Illinois, 24%; Purdue, 22; Northwestern, 18%; Ohio State, 15; Chicago, 7%; and Iowa, 0.
present and was informed that I had missed his present average by 22 percentage points. God bless the statisticians! -1-1— The Wesleyan coach. Bob Voights, and Don Heap, the sucker’s football coach, run the athletic policies of that little school. Bob and Don are recent graduates of Northwestern University and |are two of the swellest coaches I’ve ever met. —I-I— I thought sure that Voights, the baseball coach for the Hlini team, would raise Hail Columbia at having to play those wearysome innings in the rain, especially when his star pitcher, Zeits, started to complain about a sore arm from the dampness. —I-I— Voights told us that as long as the home coach wanted to play, it Was his duty as a polite visitor to comply. Let’s have more of these coaches. And you should hear this Voights fellow ask his players advice during the game. No wonder he’s got a team that backs him to the man. —I-I— Felix Mackiewicz has long and loudly wanted to pitch a ball game, and yesterday hurled the last inning for the Boilermakers. Did well, too; only one run marked up against him, and Illinois Wesleyan wouldn’t have got it had Mac received better support in the infield.
Professional Sorority Holds Meeting Here Delta Sigma Kappa, business and professional women’s sorority, held its national convention yesterday in the Union building. The meetings for business and the election of officers were held at the Fowler hotel, however. The Lafayette chapter, the first chapter of the sorority, entertained their guests at a dance in the North ballroom with Dick Cisne and his band providing the music. Approximately three hundred couples attended the dance. Frank Meyer Seleded For '40-'41 IM junior Position
Election of intramural managers was held last week, and Frank Meyer, Lambda Chi Alpha, was elected junior manager for the second semester of 1940-41. Two sophomores. Bob Olesen, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, and Paul Bussing, Beta Sigma Psi, were elected sophomore managers with Walter Vail, Tau Kappa Epsilon as alternate. The electoral board consisted of M. Clevett, recreation director, A. Evers, junior manager, Larry Imhoff, assistant recreation director, and Miss Mary Leadbetter, intramural secretary.

Column Right—i We uncovered a little item the other day. It said, quote, “Purdue’s charter requires that on the board of regents there be one farmer, one woman, and one person of good moral character.” Looks like Old John knew women and wasn’t sure about farmers.
About this time of year there is lots of talk about study. It’s mostly talk though. If you are smart you don’t have to study. There are systems. There are cribs and universal formulas and the good old process of elimination. The most common one though is guessing. That’s the one we use. We wrote a letter home today. The old touch. Makes us feel almost as bad as if it was our own money. We hated to do it, but had no alternative. We’ve already sold all our books. ♦ ♦ ♦ They snagged a couple of fifth columnists around here the other day we heard. Looks mighty suspicious; like they were trying to cut our lifeline to the north. The Monon. * * * J. Edgar’s men got them though. Lucky for us.

Imagine how it would be with all communications cut, Living off emergency rations from the Triple XXX,
A nice bit of tragedy to get off to a good start. There was once a girl named Betty Webber who was madly in love with a fellow back home. They were very serious about one another and this summer, so it is said, intended to wed. My, that sounds like a poem. Into this idyllic affair stepped the villain, Jordon McCarty, and with his wicked wiles lured fair Betty from her true love and the other day decorated her with his Beta pin. —B & B—

While strolling idly about in the Union yesterday, Ye Ed was suddenly shocked to see Wilma Bear back at her old haunts. What old haunts ? Why George Baker, of course. That man must have something. —B & B— Lost—Two dollars. Jack Stewart bet the aforementioned sum that never again would he put his pin out. It’s gone. Who took it? For the best answer in three words or less we will award*a grand prize of . . . —B & B— About the best dumb frosh story we have heard was told to us a while ago. Jack Ely left his abode in the SAE house early one morning for his eight o’clock and in his usual half dazed condition forgot his glasses. And the doctor had told him to wear them, too. Reaching the campus, he called up the house and told a freshman (name withheld) to bring his glasses (to him. The pledge said he would be glad to. In a few minutes he showed up with two beer glasses which formerly had decorated Jack’s dresser. How was he to know? —B & B— Sudden thought — does Kae Web-
er walk arm in arm with everyone or just the select fifteen or so we have seen her with.
What do you think of an organized Purdue ed importing an Indiana co-ed for the Cary Hall formal ? That in itself is bad enough, but imagine his embarrassment when he found out that he needed a bid on top of his good looks f(jr admission. Ginny Heller, the Indiana co-ed, remarked that she liked the Blue Flame Room in the Fowler better anyway. The good looking ed was none other than Ed Antonini ex Exponent big gun. —B & B— I wonder if Alpha Chi, Miss Lois S. Simpson, will be any more interested in Alpha Chi Rho, Hal Taylor, now that he is going to have a brand new convertible coupe at school to help them out with their finals. I hear that they are both pretty smart and don’t have to worry about such things as exams.
