meM Best Teaeher award, Sigma DMta Ghi members are cencerfled w discovering those qualities that mi?ike h, gpp4 tesMien in a si^opl this size there are going to be many good teachers, each with a personality and teaching style of his own. Thus the question is: What is a good teacher? What feiowledge can he give has students and how hard is it for students to grasp his ideas ^ Aoove all a teacher must be fair. If a teachqr is known for anything, it is his fairness (U: unfairness. If he creates the attitude among his students that he is fair, he haq the first vital possession of a good teacher. W good teachers it is imppsfihte to omit the fact tkat they should have the ability to create an interest in their kdhjeet W^b is interested in everything? It is the teacher’s job to make his topic so interesting that loosely regulated civilians will not cut class. Furthermore, how does the tePci|®i' terpret his theoretical material to practical application? To the engineering student the practical application is ihost important; to the teacher it means continual research in his field. Nothing is so boring to students as ^ teaclier with a set pattern of teaching. ”So-and-So’s Class is where I catch up on my sleep, is the usual typing of those teachers. Versat^ty, interestingness, fairness, and friendliHeSfr^—those are good teacher qualities. That is Why Sigma Delta Chi feels that the best of Burdue’s teachers should be honored. 'The selections must be made carefully and not on the basis of prejudices. To aid in this year’s selection for the award> SDX has asked the help of the student body in nominating candidates.
