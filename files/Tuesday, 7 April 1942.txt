University To Start Experimental Work On Corn Diseases Experimental woik pertaining to the development of hybrid field and sweet coin h^s been tiansfeiicd from Toledo, Ohio, to the Univeisity Agricultural Experiment Station. Three men who have been developing coin which is resistant to the lavages of the Eiiiopean coin boi er have moved fi om Toledo to W. Lafayette. They will continue theii expel iments heie in cooperation with the Univeisity but undei the direction of the U. .S, Depaitment of Agiicultuio. f Transferred Men Those men who have been tiansferred heie aie L. H. Patch, m charge of field corn hybrid experimental work; M. Schlosberg, in chaige of sweet corn experimental woik; and R. T. Eveily, raiser of borers to infect plants in the laboratory, Boieis are numerous enough in this tciritory to carry on regular field expel iments. Definite pi ogress has been made in the development of varieties of hybiid corn, and some of the boier damage which has caused considerable loss to Indiana corn growers within the last few years will be offset by this woik. Due to the lapid spread and multiplication of the borer in thi.s area, it i.s hoped that control measures can be developed. The work has been started on land leased by the Experiment Station and will be in cooperation with Univeisity entomologists and agrono-
mists.
