The Week’s NEWS
Washington Political objective: to make the nation McNutt-conscious. Means employed: the most gigantic, glamorous reception ever staged in Washington, personally supervised by Indiana’s Representative Jim Farley, Politician Frank McHale, and Senator Sherman Minton. With the stage carefully set, Hoosier Ex-Governor Paul V. McNutt, U. S. high commissioner of the Philippines, put his candidacy for the 1940 Presidential nomination before the country with the time-worn, sure-fire announcement, “I am not a candidate for any public office.” Host Minton sent 4,000 notes to invite influential Democrats to come to Washington’s biggest ballroom Thursday and meet the handsome gentleman from Indiana. . . . McNutt smiled and shook the hands of 3,141 men and women who gazed awe-eyed at the near - Hollywood extravaganza which cost someone between $4,500 and $7,500.
In Washington for the McNutt festivities, Governor Townsend reported to the President that Indiana has 218,000 persons out of work—as compared with 140,000 unemployed in January, 1937.
Senators shelved the anti-lynch-ing bill this week after it wasted 29 days in filibuster, and passed the $250,000,000 Roo*sevelt requested relief appropriation.
Prolonged illness may keep Associate Justice Benjamin N. Cardozo away from the bench for the remainder of his life, according to yesterday’s reports. Ailing from heart disease, the 68 year old Supreme Court member recently suffered a stroke and his left side is now paralyzed. Should Cardozo die or resign. President Roosevelt will have his third Supreme Court vacancy to fill within a year. National Old age, plus rheumatic ailment and a dangerously weakened heart wore thin the life thread of U. S. General John J. Pershing this week. Doctors moved Pershing to a (Continued on page 4)
Frosh Lay Dance Plans Tomorrow Plans for the Green Potters’ dance will be formed tomorrow at 4 o’clock in room D of the Union, when freshman eds meet to arrange for the first dance sponsored independently by this organization. Tentative plans set the date for Saturday, April 9. No Friday evenings could be scheduled. The dance will not be a closed affair for freshmen only, but will be a mixer, sponsored by the organization. Committees for the dance will be selected at the meeting, it was announced by Green Potter President Charles Gibson. Camera Club Exhibits Varied Prints In Union Attracting much attention at the camera club exhibit in the music room of the Memorial Union Building, is Robert Buckles’ stilllife picture of a porcelain dog and a small elephant. Outstanding among the pictures of University buildings is a snow scene with University Hall in the background. Other shots were taken in the Grand Canyon, Florida, and Arizona. Most of the 33 prints are 11x14 inch enlargements; the majority of them being landscapes, with some still-life, and very few candid shots. The exhibit will be open all day today and will close tomorrow, when it will be taken down to send, as a traveling exhibit, to eight or 10 other universities. Three Named Candidates For Forestry Honor Norman Gamso, Ercell Cummins, and Hillis Guyer, senior forestry students, were declared candidates for the senior Forestry Club award yesterday by a committee of faculty members and the club president. They will be voted on by Forestry Club members at a future meeting to determine the winner of the award, a Keuffel and Essfer militai’y box compass. The award is based on scholarship, popularity, neatness, interest in the Forestry Club and professional forestry, and attitude as a student.
Big Ten Standings
Riveters Take First Place In Big Ten Race
By Dick Obenchain Exponent Sports Editor
Bloomington, Ind., Feb. 26.—Jewell Young continued his scoring drive down the home stretch of the Big Ten individual scoring race here tonight as he paced the Boilermakers to a 50 to 36 win over the Crimson of Indiana. The Boilermaker ace scored seven times from the field and five times from the free throw line to go into the lead in the individual scoring competition with 145 points for 10 games. Illinois
and Dehner did not play tonight.
The Boilermakers’ victory put them in front in the Western Conference wth eight wins against two defeats. Purdue pulled away from the idle Northwestern squad who has only
seven victories and two losses. The Boilermakers got off to an early lead on free throws by Young and Malaska and gradually piled up a lead in the first hafi which the Crimson could not overcome by their second half rallies. The Indiana boys came out on the floor with a 28 to 12 disadvantage at the stait of the second half and outscoied the Boilermakers 24 to 22 during this period. Bill Johnson carried the entire Indiana attack as the Crimson forward scored five field goals and
SIX free throws. Gene Gets 10
Gene Anderson picked up 10 points during the contest to bring his season total to 91, while Johnny Sines came through with four field baskets and a charity toss. Malaska contributed two goals and scored four times from the flee throw mark without a miss. Young’s scoring tonight gives him a total of 425 points in three years of Big Ten competition to break the old record of 416 held by Chicago’s Bill Haarlow. Jewell’s combined record for the current season—^for both Conference and other games—is 247 points for 18 games, or an average of almost 18 per game.

10 Per Cent Of Students Work On NYA Projects By R. Johnson Thirteen graduate students and 518 undergraduates are included on the roles of the NYA at the University. These students work at various jobs on the campus, and in Boy Scout, YMCA, and recreation club activities in Lafayette. The number of houi’s assigned to each student is determined by considering the time that the student can spare from academic activities and still keep a satisfactory scholastic record. Rates The rates per hour for NYA work vary with the nature of the work and the number of hours that a student can devote. Thirty-seven hours per month is the greatest number of hours that a student may work—the pay being 30 cents an hour. Students working 32 hours a month receive a remuneration of thirty-five cents per hour and forty cents per hour is paid to persons employed 28 hours a month. An average of $11.20 per month is earned by NYA workers. Six thousand, four hundred six-ty-five dollars per month is the sum alloted to Purdue for NYA activities. According to G. R. Sharpe, University supervisor for this work, approximately $6,900 was paid in wages for the month ending February 9. A balance of about $500 from the preceding month, when added to the monthly allotment, made up the payroll of $6,900. Act Will Expire June 9 The present NYA act will expire June 9 of this year. What further provisions will be made in this direction of financial aid to students remains to be seen.

W6AA To Continue Farm Broadcasts Wednesday Continuing the regular MondayWednesday - Friday farm programs, WBAA will offer “Farm Facts for Farm Folks,” a talk by G. W. Sample, next Wednesday, March 2, from 12 to 12:15 p. m. “Oat Smut Treatment” and “Agricultural Students’ Interests on the Campus” will be the topics under discussion on the following Friday at the same time. The schedule of similar programs has been completed up to and including Wednesday, March 30. Matinee Visitors To “^French Follies^ See Quite Unusual Show By the Roving Reporter Instead of a grand, super-spe-cial, super-collosal, super-superla-tive, super-super-super spectacle of the show world, first matinee visitors to the “French Folies” at the Mars Theater early yesterday afternoon were treated to quite a different show. In the place of the first show, the management opened the curtains, and a full house watched the stage crew erect scenes and sets for the production. The cause—the train transporting the troupe was delayed, arriving in Lafayette three hours late. The spectacle was delayed from the scheduled 1:30 showing until 3:45 in the afternoon.
^Demand For Wheat Causes Unrest’—Henry The demand for wheat and other foodstuffs is the seat of much of the political unrest in Europe and the Orient today, declared Clarence Henry, educational director of the Chicago Board of Trade, Fiiday night. Hemy spoke at an open meeting of Ceres, honorary agronomy society, in Agricultural Hall. Henry declared that the United States, because it produces only a fourth or fifth of the world’s wheat, could do little to raise the price of wheat by crop control as has been attempted with recent government programs. The speaker was formerly assistant state leader of agents on the University staff. Douglas Will Attend KDP National Convention Lawerence Douglas, Sc. ’38, has gone to Atlantic City, N. J., where he will attend the National Convention of Kappa Delta Pi, national education honorary, as delegate of the local chapter. The convention will be in session from February 28 to March 2. Dr. John Dewey, nationally famous philosopher, will be one of the speakers at the convention.

Illinois University’s squash team dropped every match to the Boilermakers yesterday afternoon in a meet at Champaign, in which nine Gold and Black squashmen were victorious. In matches against the Illinois faculty, Coach Clevett, Linn, and Juve each won, 3-2, while Eberhard took his match, 3-1. Linn, Juve, and Ebei’hard each whitewashed their Illini opponents, 3-0, in the student matches, while Munro won his match, 3-1, and Blitz won a 3-2 match, to completely shut-out their opponents. Badminton Finishing the scheduled six matches with three victories each, the University of Illinois badminton players and the Boilermaker representatives were forced to play off the tie in an extra match between Billings of Purdue and Skov of the Illini. Billings won two straight sets to give the victory to the men from Purdue. Hill and Skov of Illinois won the first two matches over Mann and Romanovich of Purdue, respectively. Then Goldstein and Billings of Purdue tied the meet with wins over Curtis and Williams, respectively, of Illinois.

Netmen In Last Home Appearance Tomorrow Night Hot on the trail of a Western Conference basketball championship, the Boilermaker netmen will endeavor to take another step higher in their climb to the title when they meet the Chicago Maroons tomorrow night in the Pieldhouse. In the last two weeks the Maroons have drawn considerable attention because of their recent upsets of Iowa and Illinois. Going into the Iowa game the Maroons had in their possession a record of 33 consecutive losses and were counted on, by the “experts,” to add another loss to their defeat string, but the Maroons stepped onto the Iowa court and beat the Hawkeyes by sinking long shots. Just to show that their win over Iowa was not a case of playing over their heads, the Chicago lads defeated the powerful Illinois outfit, 43-39, last week. Tomorrow night’s game will mark the last home appearance of Purdue’s hardwood musketeers. Sines, Young, and Malaska, and reserves Holloway and Mangas. ISew Sport Appears In Gym Basement Continliing the program designed to make a game for everyone, the intramural department has just initiated another recreational activity, box hockey. The game is played around a box nine feet by four feet, which is partitioned in the middle. In the base of the partition is a small opening, through which the ball may pass. The object of the game is to prevent the opponent from knocking the ball through the opening. Equipment, now available, includes softballs and hockey sticks. Box hockey is made for two people to play at a time.

Lemen And Knapp Each Win In Two Events As Northwestern Is Defeated Led by Captain Bob Lemen and Alden Knapp, Coach Harmon Phillips’ track squad defeated Northwestern’s speedsters, 47-39, in the Fieldhouse yesterday afternoon before
800 track fans.
In winning the 60 yard dash. Bob Lemen not only took first place, but also tied the ancient Boilermaker record made by Hoffman of the 1911 Purdue track team. The closest contested race of the afternoon was this race, which saw/ Lemen, Delong, and BlumentWl all hit the tape within inche^.*^ each other, Lemen getting^he nod of the judges.
Knapp Wins Mile
Alden Knapp, Boilermaker distance star, showed the Wildcats nothing but his heels in both the mile and two mile runs. Apparently he could have beaten the existing Purdue mile record held by Orvil Martin, but during the last lap of the mile Knapp coasted to victory, rather than strain himself for the approaching two mile grind. Without using a strong sprint, Knapp came within seven seconds of the existing mile record set by Martin in 1932. Bodeau ran a beautiful race in the half mile run to outdistance his nearest rival by ten yards. In the pole vault, Horton of Purdue and Drake of Northwestern tied for first place at eleven feet, six inches. After taking an early lead in the half mile relay, Purdue’s relay team fell behind in the final sixty yards of a see-saw affair to
lose.
Individual scoiing honors went to Lemen and Knapp of Purdue who captured a total of ten points
each.

The Week’s NEWS
(Continued from page 1) Tucson, Ariz., hospital Tuesday when his condition became critical. Friday he slipped into a deep coma, was placed in an oxygen tank, but continued to sink fast. “You’re going to make it, sir,” encouraged his personal aid and 10-year companion Sergeant C. C. Schaeffer during- a fleeting moment of consciousness. “Sure,” the General smiled, then lapsed again into the coma. Later he lost entirely the power of speech, even while conscious. Doctors hold little hope for recovery of the 77 year old commander-in-chief of America’s Expeditionary Forces.
Detroit’s Brown Bomber, Joe Louis, collected $40,522 for eight minutes’ work at defending his world’s heavyweight boxing title Wednesday night. His opponent, Connecticut’s Nathan Mann, took the count of 10 in the third round of the fight . . . held in Madison Square Garden, New York City. Thursday Louis contracted to fight Harry Thomas, Eagle Bend, Minn., heavyweight. April Fool’s Day will see Louis and Thomas boxing for the championship crown in the Chicago Stadium.
Red River, famed in song and story, burst two southwestern Arkansas levees Tuesday, threatening lowland farms and the city of Fulton. Meanwhile nearly 2,000 workers were fighting to keep Arkansas River flood waters out of their Pine Bluff homes. Crest time came Wednesday night; now the water is receding and rebuilding will begin.
G-men revealed yesterday an international plot to steal and sell United States secrets, after arresting three men seeking army and navy information in New York. Now in custody are transatlantic liner employee Johanna Hoffman of Dresden, Germany; former U. S. army sergeant Gunteher Gustave Rumrich, allegedly a deserter; and Rich Glaser, Mitchell field soldier. Caught while attempting to obtain 50 passports by impersonating Secretary of State Hull, Rumrich confessed, caused the other two arrests. He admitted receiving money from agents of foreign governments in exchange for military secrets.
Forestry Graduate Accepts Texas Job Robert F. Eager, For. ’37, left yesterday with Mrs. Eager for Orange, Tex., where he has accepted a position with the Texas Creosoting Company. Following his graduation last June, Eager was employed by the International Lead Company at East Chicago.
Business Before an order to abolish the old soft coal minimum prices could go into effect, the Federal bituminous coal commission started Thursday to formulate new minimum prices. The commission’s decision to abolish old standards went into effect at midnight Friday. Railroad and industrial firms protested the first set of prices with the claim that failure of the commission to hold public hearings on the proposal made minimum prices illegal. The courts upheld this opinion, so the commission is starting over . . . this time holding public hearings before it makes decisions.
Michigan waved the white flag this week in the Indiana-Michigan beer feud. Hale G. Knight, liquor commissioner of the northern state, said Michigan would repeal its law against Hoosier beer if Indiana in turn would annul its law against trucking in alcoholic beverages from Michigan. In the meantime Hoosier brewers are looking for ways to evade the Michigan law. Two possibilities appeal*, beer can be sent from Illinois, where several Hoosier brewers operate plants, or breweries can be established just across the border in Michigan. War Chinese flyers carried battle to Japan for the first time since 1864, Wednesday, when an air squadron 1 aided Formosa—Nipponese island colony, Chinese officials claim. 12 planes took part in the attack, destroyed 40 Japanese airships. The Japanese Colonial Ministry said eight planes attacked the island, ad mitted 10 were killed, 30 wounded. Main results; an increasing fear of China’s new air power in Japan proper, and apparent vulnerability of large Japanese cities. Zooming out of cold winter sky, a lone British flyer of the Chinese International air squadron powerdived on a Japanese aircraft carrier, loosed three bombs. On landing, he reported three hits, said the ship was crippled, limping toward Formosa.
Hwameipao, American - owned Chinese newspaper in Shainghai, was bombed Thursday for the second time since the conflict started. Chinese police killed the bomber, seized an accomplice, blamed Japanese “counter-terrorists” for the incident.
Insurgent Generalissimo Franco’s troops recaptured Teruel Tuesday from its. loyalist defenders. Using 50 heavy field guns, flame-spitting tanks, and 100 airplanes, they blasted their way into the city from the north. Foreign Austrian independence at any cost , . . was the challenge Chancellor Kurt Schuschnigg hurled at Dictator Hitler this week. Thousands of Social Democrats and
Jews rallied around the Chancellor yesterday to support his stand against Germany. World-wide belief that der Fuhrer had completely Nazified Austria received a setback late yesterday when Hans Schmid, pro-Nazi Mayor of Graz, resigned. The mayor quit because his hidden Swastika was found.
Death knell of the League of Nations reverberated throughout the world early this week as England’s Foreign Minister Anthony Eden gave up his office. Eden has championed the League since its creation. The resignation followed friendly gestures toward Italy by the British. Meanwhile, France and other democratic powers wonder why Efigland deserted them for the European dictators. Mussolini has promised to withdraw his volun-
