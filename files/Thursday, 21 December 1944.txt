'fMs year it’s Gary Halls for Pardue’s .V-12fers, restricted in our current polio stare. We have a lot of admiration for the way the restrictees are taking their bad break. If any students are deserving of the Order of the Lopsided Star, they are, eVeft though it’s no substitute for a home-town view of a tie Star of Bethlehem. As a part of their policy of being good sports about the situation, our servieehienT iii-rffefireiHent have kept the campus amused for the last week with thOir plans for ah :''ersatz>Ghristnias. a? k.a'Sailors in the chemistry labs have been seen fashioning tree decorations from glass, while other V-12s are furnishing pulchritude in the-guise of a contest to determine the “Girl We’d Most Like To Be Restricted With.” M^vy theme-song of the. week has been chahlfed to read': “Dashing through the snOw, With a ease of polio . ..” Civilian grumbling about the length of Christmas vacation has mysteriously disappeared, and the home front effort has been directed instead toward carols, carols, and more carols for the inmates of the Ship. Wo know that this may not be the mer^ rie^ Christmas for our servicemen here, nor is ft for those on battlefields too busy giving us peace to observe the birthday of the Prince of Peace. But'we know that the s6hse of humor and goocf will with which these servicemen have taken their restriction is in the true spirit ofv this holiday’s Originator.—Tp.m.
