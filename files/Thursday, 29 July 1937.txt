FR’s Approval Awaited For PWA HaU Aid
WRH To Be Finished Next Week; Field House Ahead of Schedule
University officials are still waiting for President Roosevelt’s approval of the PWA construction of a new men’s dormitory here, according to a statement issued last night by Prof. Frank Hockema. Professor Hockema said that the University is very desirous of obtaining the new dormitory.
A, E. Kemmer, ’02, local contractor, Said last night that the new unit of the Women’s Residence Hall, which is to house 80 upper class girls and aboht 60 freshmen co-eds, will be completed next week.
Ahead Of Schedule Kemmer also announced that the additions to the Physics and Service and Stores Buildings will be completed by September 1. Construction IS running ahead of schedule on the Field House, and the contractors expect to finish it before the contracted time of November 17.
Bids for the new Horticultural Building and for the remodeling of Fowler Hall have not been submitted yet.
ISew Directory Of City Includes Purdue Sketch
Just off the press and now being delivered by R. L. Polk and Co., Lafayette’s largest and most complete city directory contains 836 pages of information concerning Lafayette, West Lafayette, and Tippecanoe county. A sketch about the University and a short story of Lafayette are included in the volume.
University's First Movie Wins Praise Of Premier Showing^s Select Audience
Previews of the first University sound pictures were shown last night in Michael Golden Shops before the cast and a group of guests including Dean Potter, Assistant Dean Knapp, Controller R. B. Stewart, Dean Enders, A. P. Stewart, and G. S. Meikle.
Prefacing the actual showing of the 16-minute picture was a brief explanation of the film by Director H. Kenn Carmichael. Carmichael stated that the selection of the story, based on the escapades of the Brady gang, was not accidental, but that the actual story was.
The film, hingeing around the exploits of one “Dimples” Dawson, played by Bill Brotherton, starts with the stealing of an automobile from in front of the new Administration Building and an airplane pursuit of robber Dawson by state police from the University airport.
I Action Shifts To Farm The^scene of action shifts to the Brandstetter farm near Klondike where Bob, played by Henry Miller, and Jim, enacted by Joe Dupree, capture the desparado. Marjorie Bayne and Hank Miller furnished the love element of the show, while Joe Dupree amuses the audience with his affectionate caressing of Daisy Belle, a guernsey cow. Other players are Patricia Heine and Julia Graves.
Prom the standpoint of entertainment, photography, dramatics, and sound control the first Purdue sound movie is successful. Some of the characters, however, are unnecessary for the plot development.
Carmichael said concerning last night’s preview, “The crowd laughed when it was supposed to.” When asked how many man hours had been spent in preparing the produc-
tion Carmichael stated that a conservative estimate would place the time at about 3,600 hours.
Better Than Expected Prof. Justus Rising, photographer for the production, thought that the show turned out better than had been expected.
Stanley Meikle, head of the Purdue research foundation, when questioned about last night’s performance said, “Excellent.” It is the forerunner of better things to come in the way of visual education.”
The unseen participants in the production, including Art Radkey, dialogue manager, John Ditamore, sound technician and his assistants, Henry Thonapson and Ralph Townsley, Owen Stallard and Pat Heine, production managers, and the business staff composed of Sue Enders, Mary Yeager, Paul Worcester, and Tom Herrick, all deserve fine hands for their parts in making the show a success^
ROTC Cadets End

AUyn Speaks Tomorrow On State Snakes
Dr. William P. Allyn, zoologist at Indiana State Teachers College, who will speak in the faculty lounge of the Memorial Union Buildingtomorrow night, is
regarded as one of the nation’s outstandicng authorities on reptiles
His speech for tomorrow is entitled “Studies On Venomous Reptiles Of Indiana,” and he will illus-
trate his talk with stationary pictures taken by him in the field, and with 1,600 feet of motion pictures.
Gains Wide Attention Dr. Allyn recently gained nationwide attention for his widely publicized experiments in biological control of termites, using a species of cockroach which demonstrated an amazing appetite for termites in test tube experiments. At present he is staging a practical test of his findings.
Much of the material to be used by Dr. Allyn in his convocation speech will appear in the forthcoming “Proceedings Of The Indiana Academy Of Science.”
Dr. Allyn is a graduate of Purdue with the B.S. degree in 1924, and M.S. in 1926. He received his Ph.D. at the University of Wisconsin in 1931.

There is a “perfect figure” somewhere on the University of Toronto campus. No one except “Miss Venus” herself, and Dr. Edith Gordon, university medical adviser, knows and she refuses to tell her secret. “I have been examining students for 15 years and each year I live in hopes of meeting the perfect woman,” she informed the physical education section of the Ontario Educational Association. “This year I met her. “Sometimes their backs are too long or too short, sometimes they have too long or too short a neck, sometimes their thighs are too long or short. It is most interesting this study of sjnnmetry and proportion. “And when you find a perfect one, it is as great a thrill as when you find a beautiful piece of statuary— only more so because it is living.” * * * *
What may be conclusive evidence that one need not be dumb to be beautiful is discovered in a grade study at Indiana State Teachers College' which shows that the combined averages of the 24 coeds who vied for various beauty honors during the past year was considerably above the general grade average. Eight of the coed beauties were classed by their professors as “very superior” students. * * * *
The one-man cast, Prof. Isaac Cochran of Carleton College, has memorized over 1,000,000 words. He acts ^scores of Shakespearean and modem plays by himself.
A Ph. D. at Willamette University has suggested that all infants of diseased mentality be given an easy death with chloroform, to prevent them from maturing into undesirables to be supported by the now overtaxed public—^but where would our future politicians come from? * * * *
Much of the success of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers has been attributed to the fact that they are
knoc|l-kneed; the California Osteopathic Association makes this state-
ment.
Some students are punished for going fishing, but those in Prof. Moore’s class get credit for it. Frequent trips to lake and stream for various kinds of Jish are part of the regular procedure in the zoology course at Oklahoma A. & M. * * * *

Letters to
the Editor
(Editor’s Note: After preseniang lighter side of college life at University
of Michigan — from the
viewpoint—last week, Dorothe^ Jnstin tnms to the more serious aspects of that institution. Today she portrays Michigan’s famons Law Quadrangle. The law school at Ann Arbor ranks high among the nation’s universities which offer de-
grees in jurisprudence.)
Ann Arbor, Mich., July 28, 1937.
Dear Rip,
The Law Quadrangle, newly erected, is the present show-place of Michigan University. English in design, the buildings are built around an inside court, so that they form a rectangle. Towers, ivy-covered walls, myrtle terraces, all give the impression of an old English college. Were it not for the spic newness of the limestone blocks of which the buildings are constructed, and the shiny, hardware-store look of the metal trimmings, the illusion would be complete.
Inside, however, the modernness and convenience of all parts take direct leave of the English college idea. Steam heat, sound proof walls, indirect lighting, inlaid linoleum, sanitary water fountains, and fire protection features are among the first evidences of modern engineering and architecture.
Great lecture halls, Sloping'to the rostrum, are also used as recitation halls or courts for the embryo lawyers. The large rooms are equipped with tables and chairs. The windows are stained with pictures of medals, judges, scenes of Greek law decisions. There are smaller recitation rooms with balconies additional. The boys, weary from study, sit on the balconies over the green courtyard and take a siesta.

SUNDAY
Washington With the north woods pulling and the hot weather pushing, a movement got under way this week among congressmen to adjourn the big show soon and get out of sultry Washington. Legislators watched anxiously as delay threatened their vacations in the form of the Black-Connery Wages-Hours bill which came up for consideration in the senate Tues-

day. Opponents threatened to tack on the proposed federal anti-lynch-ing bill. This would mean a pro-
longed filibuster.
Efforts were redoubled to put the lower court reform hill, which will
> . . . ^replace the original court packing
shape for senate consid-
eration. Legislation to plug tax evasion loopholes may be submitted
next week.
President Roosevelt stirred controversy Wednesday when he hinted he may break another precedent soon by withholding the name of his appointee to the Supreme Court until the senate, which must confirm, has gone home.
Show The Lady Around A large library, conducted like other libraries, but containing only law books, is housed by itself at a 'corner of the quadrangle. The boys say it holds an extensive and a fine collection. In the large reading room the atmosphere was one of holy quiet. The men were poring over their books, and there was scarcely a sound but the rustling of pages when things had quieted down after our entrance. The assistant dean of the law school, a fifth year lad in law, and an editor of the Daily were showing the “young lady from Purdue” around.
Labor Dawn broke over Cleveland, O., Tuesday morning and revealed one dead and nearly 100 laborers badly injured in another of the battles which spot the bitter war waging between labor and capital. The entrance to Republic Steel Corporation’s Carrigan-McKinney plant furnished the setting for a five hour night battle between company workers and rioting pickets which climaxed sporadic fighting all day Monday. Company sympathizers raided and wrecked the Steel Workers Organization Committee’s headquarters. Feeling became so intense Cleveland’s Safety Director Eliot Ness prohibited further assemblies in the vicinity of the Republic Steel plant. The death of John Orecny,'Republic steel worker for the past 16 years, brought the toll of violent deaths to 16 in the two months old steel strike. The supply of meat and staple foodstuffs ran low in Buffalo, N. Y., as the C. I. O. rejected proposals to end a strike of 8,000 truck drivers and warehouse workers. In Washington, Rep. John Rankin (D., Miss.) sought removal of National Labor Relations Board members^ whom he charged “ruthlessly” closed a Mississippi cotton mill and were engaged in “communistic activities” in an attempt to destroy southern industry.
At the corner opposite the library stands a chapel. It is lovely on the outside, but closed most of the time. We didn’t go in. It didn’t seem neces sary or congruous, I guess.
There is a large section reserved for the men to live in—areally sumptous quarters, but expensive. Private baths or showers, radios, beau tiful living rooms, a huge dining room, and a beauty parlor sort of place were the most memorable features. Unfortunately we just skimmed the dorms.
Everything For A Living One lad remarked that students could enter the Quadrangle as sophomores and not leave until they got their degrees if ^ey didn’t date. The barber shop and shoe shining place, with its little shop for shaving lotions, brushes, combs and all such personal incidentials is an appreciated convenience.
Dances are held twice a semester, and fancy ones they are! The lawyers have a fued with the engineers, and try to hold their biggest dance the night the engineers hold their famous “Slipstick Brawl.” Naturally, each try for the choicest dates, and girls are dotted for three months ahaad of time.
Beautiful, remarkable, complete -no wonder it's a showplace.

Foreign Yellowmen saw red this i^eek and dropped diplomatic tactics to declare a fact what has long been war. As Japanese troops and munitions were moved into North China, skirmishing in and around Peiping, key city of the area, became fierce and bloody. Momentary issue was made of China’s rejection of Japan’s ultimatum demanding evacuation of the Peiping area by Chinese troops. China is determined to resist Japan’s apparent attempt to gain control of North China. The railroad from Peiping to the sea offered an objective for Japanese bombs and infantry movements. Over 1,000 Chinese were reported killed by aerial bombs at Langfang. Reports indicate little other order to the other skirmishes Orientals staged outside of Peiping. Inside the ancient city, 20 Nippon soldiers were reported trapped and killed by Chinese. Foreigners sought protection within embassy quarters. U. S. Marines erected a sandbag barricade around the American embassy as gunshots crackled occasionally in street fighting. Ireland greeted British royalty in best tradition Wednesday when King George VI and Queen Elizabeth made a coronation visit to Belfast. Free state Irishmen displayed their sentiments by burning customs houses, dynamiting a railroad, blowing up a gas main in Belfast and terrorizing the countryside and police by roving in armed bands.
NOTICES
No notlcM accapM afMr S lb
There’s something about these cool summer mornings that give us the disposition of a grimly bear ... sleep suddenly shattered by an alrm clock. Hurrying to make an 8 o’clock ... no letter from our gal in Chicago . , . why shouldn’t we feel like that ?
From here on, friends and enemies both take a beating. On our way to the Sweet Shop a man pulls away from the curb into our path and into just about the best cussing he’s had in years. We finally make the Sweet Shop for toast and chocolate. Waitresses seem especially dumb this morning. Drake ends up in second place- which, although he was third yesterday, is a little disappointing—what the hell, we voted. “Caravan” fails completely as a nerve easer and seems to be the godawfulest collection of foul noises that we have ever heard.
As we leave the Union in our dash to double E, we find that it is again six till eight—^it’s always six till. Why doesn’t someone fix the clock. The fafees aren’t synchronized (that is the ^ord for it) and the bell rings at two till. Can we make our 8 o’clock in the E.E. building? Hell, no. It takes little imagination to discover our reaction towards “A pioneer inventor, a builder of industry, a leader of men, a benefactor of Purdue Univer^y—1930.” (Thomas Duncan’s dedication above the ^north door of the double E building.)
The bell rings aM we debate whether to go in late again or cut. W© have already cut twice this week so decide to climb the two more flights of stairs. Near the end of the hour we become impatient and almost eager to get away from that damn class.
Already we feel a little better as we join the gang in front of the Recitation building. We wait here until that gal (rather small, slender and beautiful—it would be worth Mars passes to find her name) passes and the whole mob of us go into class. It’s Doc Owen’s business

fielder’s.... * ....choice I I •uanMmmmW ’ By Don Bailey John Drake and George Bell have been chosen members of the AllStar College team Which will meet the Green Bay Packers bn September 1. Drake was selected as one of the half backs to start the game while Bell ranked third among the centers. Over five million votes Were cast in the poll taken to pick the collegiate eleven. .. _:.fc—, . The seven game winning sfareak of the Boston Bees was finally broken Tuesday by the Cincinnati Reds. Previous to this the Bees had taken the Cards and the Pirates to the cleaners. In Wiiming 22 out of their last 31 games Bill McKenchnie’s pitchers have allowed only 84 runs in 279 innings. During their recent winning streak the Bean City nine turned back the opposition with an everage 'euiuS J9d sunj xi'T puu s^iq xis jp Coupling these statistics with the fact that Boston is a sorry eighth in team batting in' the National League, we present them as our exhibit “A” in the ease goud pitching versus good hitting. —^fc— , . ■ ' America’s chances of retaining the Davis Cup next year are about as remote as playing pussy in the corner with the man in the moon. In case you hadn’t heard it Don Budge, the California Comet, is slated to desert the ranks of the Simon pure to take a slice of pro money. First it was Tilden, then Vines, then Perry, and now Budge. Sounds like a racket. ■ -fC 'Frank “Butch’’ Loebs, who as end was voted tbe most valuable player on Purdue’s 1936 football team, has just been signed as an assistant football coach at the University of Washington, at St. Louis. Loebs will serve under Jimmy Conzelman, head coach at the Missouri school. —fc—■ If President Barnes had furnished the St. Louis Browns with a few pitchers, maybe Hornsby would still be with the club. But then that’s a horse of another color. ' ■—fc— ■ Noble Kizer continues to improve. This is mighty good news to football fans as Kizer is probably the most popular coach in the game today and certainly one of the best.

For its cut^eiit book of the ihontli, Literary Guild, has selected One Life, One Kopek, by Walter Duranty.'. ^
Those interested in Walter Duranty, correspondent for the New York Times in Russia since 1920 and author of the best seller, I Write As I Please, awaited anxiously but not in vain for his first novel. Duranty began the story because he, after 15 years in Soviet Rust sia, thought he should know something about Russia and Russian psychology; however, in the midst of his writing he noticed that his hero was becoming too hard and unreal.
Swine Judges Meet Here Next Tuescley At Annual Session
A judging school in which the five leadii^ breeds pi hog^ ^1 W criticized is one of the inain; fea-; tures^ of the 49th annual lUeetifig of the Indiana Association of Expert Swine Judges to: be held at the University Tuesday.,
through exile in Siberia, throUg’h eicperiences in love and hate and through his leadership of Bolshevists in the revolution betvsreen the White Russians and the Reds.
The author laid the book aside for five years and then began work anew, changing his, main character by letting him become a little Europeanized by contacts with people not Russian.
’fc'
Kisses, Then Slaps The title. One Life, One Kopek, means “Life is a little kopek,” or, as we say, “not worth a rap.” The book takes a peasant boy, Ivan Petrovich, through childhood experiences at-the home of a rich master where the master’s little daughter kissed him and then slapped hini because his eyes -were so blue.
This book is one* that mUst be read once it is be^un. It is sociUl, not political, in outlook; and it reveals the way in Which the revolution was organized by a small group and carried through by careful planning and successful use of mob psychology, It portrays the results of the force of circumstances in molding character and of the con,fiicts between Ipve for country and love for a woman.

John Gunther, author of Inside Europe, describes One Life, One Kopek, appropriately in these few words: “It is a cruel book, perhaps, but then Russia is a cruel Country. Ivan’s story has sweep ,sting, color, guts, and a terrific veracity. Duranty must write more Russian novels.” —Anistis Franklin
