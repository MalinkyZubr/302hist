Canners Will Meet Today To Discuss Food Improvement
Drew Pearson atnd Dobcrt S. Allen "■■■‘■■y ,>JL^wls Attempts To G^t Fariners To Join Workers' Union ]|,A^]feiNGTON, Feb. 2. — John L. LcwilsTias returned to the brooding sij^ncc from which he .suddenly popped , Ijis boonicranging AFLjdl0 li^iicc scheme, but while saying jiolhing publicly, the powerhilngry miner boss is not idle. U^der cover, he is busy organitsing dairy farmers as members of tlte United Mine Workers. The farmers are in Michigan and they pre being signed up as members of Local 50, a sort of catchall UMW bi'anch, made up of units of munitions, chemical coke, cosmetics and gas workers. Head of the Local 50 are two Lewis appointees—Ora Gassaway, old-time UMW henchman, and Lewis’ daughter and former confidential secretary, Kathryn. Gassaway gets $10,000 a year; Miss Lewis, $7,600. Local 50 was recently in the news as a result of a purge of njuimber of crack organizers who oi^nH see eye to eye with Lewis’ idoli|tionist views. Directly in charge of the farmer drive ard two other Lewis henchmen—Bay Thomason, another oldtime UMW official, who attracted attention at the recent CIO convention’ when he slugged two assistants of CIO president Phil Murtiy, and Kalph Marlatt, labor publicilty- agent. According to Thomason and Marlatt over 5,000 Michigan dairy ‘ farmers have joined the union. The farmers, say Thomason and Marlatt, could get nowhere with their demands for better prices from the big dairy corporations, so they asked Lewis to tgke them under his wing. ' Thomason and Marlatt also boast that the Michigan drive is only the start of a nationwide campaign by Lewis to unionize 3,000,000 farmers. Already activities are under way to branch out into Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois and Ohio. • Strange Peacemaker In ipner CIO circles, Lewis’ farm operations are viewed as a direct hostile move against the Farmers Union, an established affiliate. That is, it is charged, Lewis is raiding a field already occupied by a CIO union. It is also indignantly pointed out that ho was engaged in these tactic^ as the very time he sprang his surprise AFL-CIO peace scheme. Further, that he is organizing the ■fariners under challengeable auIhdflty. This charge is based on language in the UMW constitution which says (Continued on page 2)

Wabash Watchman With Red Eye Heralds Entrance Of New Station WASK To Lafayette's Radio Waves
Over 1,000 Teachers To Attend Convention On Campus Saturday
Student Organizations Discussion Teams To Discuss Relief Fund To Enter 1st Round Drive At 7:30 Tonight Of Tourney TonigM
By Don Frier
We ask you: Did you know that the bleary'red eye which nightly stares at West Lafayette over the west bank of the Wabash is actually, heralding the entrance to your radio of a new voice from a dial position of one hundred and forty-five ? We didn’t know either until we drove north on the River Road to investigate. , We found the small shack, elevated on twelve foot stilts out in the bottom land, which is to house the transmitter of WASK, Lafayette. After gaining entrance to the shack by means of a ladder we*met Don Harrell, the consulting engineer in charge of constructing
the transmitter. He told us, among other things, that this was the sixty-third station he had erected since he started in
the business in 1922.
He first directed our attention to a steel cabinet which

Debris, Student Union Will Hold Freshman Callouts This Week
Debris Thursday
There will be a call-out Thursday at 4 p. m. in the Debris Business office for freshman salesmen and workers. The purpose of this meeting will he to explain duties of the workers and to divulge facts
about the new 1942 Debris.
Actual working experience is available in salesmanship, postermaking, publicity and accounting. During the year there will be Sales Contests and money and books will
be given as prizes.
No experience is necessary for
this work.
on the campus. Union workers decorate for all Union dances and make the signs 'Seen in the Union, advertisingdances. The Student Union also sponsors the traveling library of the Browning Room and the Music Room programs.
Freshman callout for Student Union workers will be held this afternodn at 4:16 in the South Ballroom of the Union. Following the meeting a tea dance, also in the South Ballroom, will be given for
all Union workers.
At the meeting, organization and work of the Student Union will be described. The senior and juniorofficers -will be introcluced, and each of the juniors will tell of the activity that he supervises. Freshmen will be assigned to work on the various committees headed by the
junior vice-presidents.
The Student Union is one of the service and social organizatiorrs on the campus. It sponsors the annual Mothers’ arrd Fathers’ Day programs* Union tea darrees, and the receptions which frequeirtly follow University convocations. The Union is sponsoring the Red Ctvss work
was about the size of a small clothes closet. It contained the actual transmitting equipment and was electrically heated to maintain a temperature which would vai-y no more than one degree from the specified operating temperature of its delicate coirtents. The transmitter has an output of two hundred and fifty watts and bears the trade mark of RCA—just like our roommate's radio, except that this will have to function much better to broadcast even a feeble peep. Harrell told us, incidentally, that the warning light on the top of the tower- requires more electric power than does the entire transrrritting equipment. Half Antenna We wei-e next taken to a window which looked out on the tower. “That tower,” the engineer told us, “is <only half of the antenna.” To alleviate our/bewilderment he explained that the other half consisted of three thousand feet of copperwire cut into lengths equalling the height of the tower and laid in the ig-round so that they radiated from the base of the tower like the spokes of a wheel. One of the principal reasons for- locating the tower- in the bottoms was to give these copperground -yvires the benefit of the very highly conductant sandy loam soil The Btudios Later- we went to the studios, which are located on the third floor of the Wallace Building, opposite the Lafayette Post Office and the Fowler Hotel. There are two studios: a program studio which is twelve feet by twenty feet and an announcing and operating studio sized ten feet by seven feet. Much information about the station’s programs was made available to us by J. M. Spring, the station manager. Operations will begin in a few weeks, at which time an eighteen hour a day schedule will be taken up. Regular features will include farm and homemaking- information, national and international news, sports, classical and popuar music, coverage of local events and local commercial advertisements. The power of the station will make up programs heard within a twenty-five mile radius of Lafayette. WASK vs. WBAA To our mind immediately came the question which has bothered all those who knew of the presence of a competitor of our- own WBAA. After consultation with both Spring of WASK and G. I. Williams, station manager of WBAA. it became evident that Aer'e would actually be very little competition between the stations because of their widely different oi-ganizations and broadcasting range. WBAA is noncoininercial and has the transmitter power- and range which permits its progranis to be produced for a state-wide audience. On the otherhand, WASK is broadcasting- on a strictly conimei-cial basis to an entirely local listening public. WASK’s policy of hiring- student announcers and operators'as far as possible also complements WBAA’s functions. According to Williams, the next step in the career of a well-trained and experienced student announcer is work in a com^nercial station of the size of WASK. With our fears dispelled by this information we may now welcome WBAA’s little rreighbor, WASK — “Indiana’s newest radio statioir.”
Lark-Horovitz Attends Physics Conference Emergency Session Dr. Karl Lark-Horovitz, head of the Physics department, has recently leturned from Iowa City wheie he attended an emergency session of the Colloquium of College Physicists, an organization representing eight states and thirty-six in-
stitutions.
Purpose of the emergency session was to find ways and means to prepare the large number of electronics men needed in industry and the armed forces.
A Telegram
During the conference, a telegram was received from Dean H. L. Dodge, University of Oklahoma, who is the Physics representative on Dean Potter’s Defense Training
Committee.
The wire said, “Physics situation getting worse constantly. Two thousand Physics graduates are needed at once, exceeding five times the current supply.” The meeting- adopted a resolution concerning the need for high school teachers to help in the pro-gi-jain. The Colloquim issued a statement that “every new teacher going into the secondary schools should be trained as a potential defense training teacher, having a minimum of twenty-foui semesterhours in college physics as an integral part of his preparation.” Electronics Again Special courses were considered in order to prepare high school graduates as electronics aids. According to Lark-Harovitz, recommendation was made that any high school graduate or college student with experience in Physics should obtain a certificate of proficiency before entering military service, stating how many hours of physics he has had, in order to facilitate placement in defense service, w.g-.h.

The finished sketches must be read> for inspection by Mi. Cahen not later than Feb. 14, following which they will be sent to St. Louis for inspection and elimination by dress designers there t Coeds Model 0>vn Designs Those designs selected as best in this judging will be made into the
finished garments by the girls who originated them, and will be modeled in a style show about the middle of March at which the final elimination will take place. Cahen hopes to have the winpini; designs made up by St. Louis manufactuiers and include the garment^ in Alan’s summer merchandise. The girls in the design classes are now making sketches of such summer wearing appai-el as sport dresses, afternoon dresses, forpaals, summer suits, and play suits. Latest Fashions They are not only obtaining practical experience in drawing technique, but are also learning to notice and include the latest fashio^ trends, such as ballet length skil'tSi: sqrplice closings to avoid fasteners* soft shouldei's, front fullness, and splashy prints. Some of the girls are speciaJiaing in certain types', of styles- For instance, Alice Coe is drawing affc« ernqpn dresses exclusively and Doris Freedman is sketching gay and colorful sport dresses, while berta Lewis is designing dainty and feminine play clothes.

“HOl^EST ABE,” the joke of the town . . . the hoy who craved an education . . . the tall, lean man who didn’t know what to do with his hands and feet. Look at him—is he such a glowing specimen of manhood? But wait, look again—can’t you see determination in his eyes?
AAD GEORGE WASHINGTON — he was born and lived and died. Why are we thinking of him — he was just the same as any other mortal. But he had a job to do — he did it. It was a tough job. Sure it was tough, but life isn’t easy. He didn’t falter — he didn’t turn back.
WE ALL HAVE A JOB TO DO . . .
‘ The goyernment is facing a shortage of trained men and materials. Our University is making every effort to give the government the trained men it needs. The students are doing their part by “staying put” and studying. But, we all can help with materials too! Paper is rapidly becoming scarce—hooks are becoming more valuable. Take care of your books — trade them in when you’re through with them — to keep them in circulation. Be saving with paper — make it last just as long as you can. Conserve on every type of material which you know is essential to our national defense.
