Air Fight Fjor Newspaper Day
On Crete
Parachutists Land On Western Coast By William H. Stoneman SPECIAL CABLE To Chicago Daily News Foreign Service. Copyright, 1941. Chicago Daily News, Inc. London, May 21. — Germany’s mighty air assault on Crete, with at least 7,000 air-borne troops and parachutists engaged in the attack. Was reported still in full swing todiay, with the issue still in doubt. According to the latest information available in London this noon, the German attack, which began early yesterday morning, was maintained throughout the day by repeated waves of bombers afid troopcarriers. Parachutists and troops, borne either in troop-carriers or gliders, continued to descend on the western end of the island, while others came down in the neighborhood of Hearakleon, otherwise known as Candia. The air attack is 1 eported to have been supplemented by at least one attempted landing by sea. English Holding At dusk last night the situation was reported to be “well in hand,” though this does not mean that anywhere nearly all the German troops had been rounded up. The British estimate, on the basis of early reports, that one airborne division is engaged in the assault though it IS not clear that the Germans already have attempted to land this entire force. A German air-borne division normally consists of approximately 7,000 men, plus parachutists, who are generally not included in the framework of the division itself. A division consists of two infantry regiments, compared to the three of an ordinary division; one artilleiy regiment, equipped with 24 75-mm. mountain guns, one antitank battalion, equipped with 37mm. guns; one divisional reconnaissance unit; signal corps troops and engineers. Germans Must Not Win Today’s London Times warns against the consequences of the German occupation of the strategic island. “If it fell into Germany’s possession,” it says, “then it would lock the gateway to the archipelago, facilitate tke attack on Egypt and vastly increase the difficulties of' our fleet in the eastern Mediterraneon. It can be taken for granted,” it adds, “that the assault will be heavy and determined.” The Times believes that the Germans will now concentrate on seizing the stretch of coast upon which sea-borne troops can be landed. Airbofn4 troops alone cannot accomplish the occupation of the entire island, it believes. Gimlet Club . . . announces the election of thefollowing officers: president, Phil Johnson; vice-president, Bill Campbell; secretary-treasurer, Jim Mercer. The elections were held just following initiation.

Aubrey Williams, national administrator of the NYA, will come to the conference to address two sessions and hold individual conferences. This is the first year in the history of the National Youth Administration that it has been the subject of college courses. One unit of work in the School Administration course at Indiana University this summer is to be devoted to the administration of the NYA student work program. The University of Chicago is conducting a similar program for one month, starting June 23. -During the past school year there bave been approximately 10,000 secondary school students and 4,000 college students employed on NYA projects in Indiana schools.

German Agents TryToRevive^ Peru-Chile War By Allen Haden SPECIAL CORRESPONDENCE Of Chicago Daily News Foreign Service. Copyright, 1941. Chicago Daily News, Inc. Buenos Aires, May 16.—(By Clipper)—Long expected Nazi moves to tie South America to the Nazi chariot have come into the open with the recent flaring up of the 100-year-old land dispute between Peru and Ecuador, Nazi undercover agents in Peru are responsible for the dispute’s revival, according to Peruvian exiles in Buenos Aires, German Agency Expelled Peru recently expelled Transocean, German news agency, from the country to stop its interference in the family row with Ecuador. Subversive activities of Nazi agents were designed to divert the attention of the United States from aiding Great Britain by furnishing a war in America’s front yard. The Nazi moves have been countered by Argentina, Brazil and the United States making an offer to mediate, which both Peru and Ecuador have accepted. The long standing quarrel has been caused by Peruvian settlers ' moving into Ecuador from west and north, upstream along the 'tributaries of the great Maranon River. This process, unless stopped, would squeeze Ecuador from territory east of the Andes. Land Greed the Cause Peru’s flag followed the settlements. Just as United States troops were sent into Spanish California to protect United States settlers there, Peruvian troops slowly moved north of the Maranon River to protect Peruvian squatters. Ecuador objected, and there have been repeated clashes of Ecuadorean and Peruvian troops over a period of years, the last important one being in 1938 at a locality known as Rocafuerfe. Land greed rather than land hunger has caused all the great disputes between American nations. This one is no exception for both Peru and Ecuador have much land and little population. Peru, with a population estimated at 6,000,000, has a population density of 12.5 per square mile in an area of 480,000 square miles, Ecuador, with an area of 175,000 square miles, has a population of about 3,000,000 and a density of 17 per square mile. In the United States population density is about 43 per square mile. Christian Church . . . will hold an old fashioned ice cream social at 126 Chauncey tonight fiom 7:30 to 9:30.

Mike Murphy Will Stunt At Airport Carnival; ^ / Program Includes Race, Parachuting; Co-eds Fly
^ By Mary K. Boynton JJemonsjtrating before the public for the first time what aviation experts claim is impossible, “Mike Murphy will perform the square outside loop at the Air Show at the University airport Sun^y afternoon at 2 o’clock. Mike, who is the permanent winner of the Freddie Lund Trophy for precision aerobatics, has practiced the maneuver privately in his Bucker-Jungmeister stunt ship. “Firsts” Here Probably because he spent his childhood near Lafayette, he usually saves the best of his “Firsts” for the yniversity’s meet. His contributions to aviation have not only thrilled thousands of spectators, but have also definitely advanced aeronautical science. The aviation engineers arp non-com-mittal concerning the new square outside loop, because they have not been able to calculate the pressure
increase which occurs in turning the corners. In the conventional outside loop, which is aviation’s most strenuous maneuver the pressure at the bottom of the loop is so great that a special permission is required by the CAA to perform the .stunt. But Mike, who is Irish and a red-head, does the square loop at greatly increased pressure and says that he knows what he is doing. Low Flying Man To see all of his stunts, Mike asserts, spectators will have to be on the field, because much of his literally streamlined program will take place within inches of the ground. The trophies which |ie won at Miami in the Lund contest, and at Havana, will be on display during the show. Before July 1, Murphy will appear in shows at Birmingham, Alabama; Des Moines, Iowa; Dayton, Ohio, and various other places.
Then, just before the Fourth of July, Mike will assume the responsibilities of a Lieutenant in the Army Air Corps. He will be assigned to the experimental section at Wright Field, Dayton, where his principal duties will be the testing and collecting of data on new and proposed fighting craft. Murphy, however, will not supply all of the thrills in the twoVhourprogram. Army planes from Wright Field will maneuver and five University co-eds will give a demonstration in CAA cub trainers. Other attractions will include parachute jumping and a pants race. Announcement of the progfam will be made by F. W. Greve, Flyipg Club president; Captain Lawrence I. Aret;^ operations manager; and Amos Richardson over thfe University’s public address system which is used for football games. Thp show is sponsored jointly by the Flying Club and the Glider Club.
War Office Rates ROTC As Excellent Unit Upholds Standards Of Former Years; Accomplishment Commended Receiving word from Maj. Gen. C. A- Trott, commander of the fifth corps area, President Elliott was informed yesterday that the University ROTC has received the rating of “Excellent” for the eighteenth consecutive time, as a result of its performance at the Inspection May 8 and 9. ,
WAA Sports Program Attracts Crowd 01300 Persons Last Evening Approximately 300 people attended the annual WAA athletic demonstration held last night in the Memorial Gymnasium. Opening the program a grqup of seniors played badminton, while juniors demonstrated volleyball and five coed archers exhibited their skill. The second section of the program consisted of group dancing the sophomores rendering a folk dance, and the freshmen doing exercises and tumbling. Following tap dancing by the sophomores, Trudy Antenen and Alice Meyer did a Schottische and Barbara Ford and Jean Steigerwald did an athletic dance. Grand March The finale was a grand march by all participants in order of their class, senior first, all singing “Hail Purdue.” This was followed by a water ballet by the Triton Club, women’s swimming organization. They gave the same ballet that was presented in the Galacade. At the end of the program the pool was opened to all women who wished to swim.
Letter’s Text The text of the letter was; “As was to be expected, the Board of Officers detailed to make the Federal Inspection of the ROTC unit at Purdue University again awards the unit a i-ating of ‘Excellent,’ The Board of Inspection was instructed to make its ratings solely on the effectiveness of instruction on the War Department Program of Instruction" without compensation for the adverse conditions inseparately a feature of this first year’s operation under the existing national emergency. High Standards ^‘Thus, the high standards heretofore set by you for your ROTC unit and the outstanding accomplishment of former years has enabled the ROTC unit at Purdue University to absorb the impact of the emergency and still attain the standard of former years. “I regard this as being highly commendable and ask that you kindly convey to all concerned my congratulations on this highly creditable accomplishment.” Inspecting Officers The officers who did the inspecting were Col. C. A. Selleck, Lieut. Col. F. H. Boucher, and Lieut. Col. G. R. Hayman, all from the fifth corp headquarters at Fort Hayes, O. e.g.k. Stage, Stump, Studio Banquet Tonight To

The great God of education on the Purdue campus is “practical” or vocational training. And now we have come to a situation called National I^efense that seems to be a perfect justification for the “practical education” philosophy. The plain truth is, however, that our practical education is very close to being a flop pure and simple; aside from the impact on his immediate life, the average engineer at Purdue doesn’t give a damn abo^t national defense. This average engineer dbesn’t know or care about the philosophic reasons behind national defense. He hasn’t the slightest bit of moral feeling about the war or anything else. It was indeed jolting to hear an intelligent (but cer-. tainly not thinking) chemical engineer tell us recently: “What differeijce does the form of government make to me. I intend to do chemistry research; why should I be concerned with politics; I can work at chemistry for the totalitarians as well as in a so-called democracy.” That statement is too close to the general engineer’s heart to be funny. , There is no need to deny that the large majority of American students are patriotic. But their patriotism is a' noisey, blatant nationalism rather than a sincere faith in democratic government. At a University of Chicago Round Table discussion. President Elliott held that one of the after effects of the present defense program would be “that we are going to attach a great deal more importance to bringing about a better civic understanding ...” Another member of the Round Table that day agreed with President Elliott and added that unless the great mass of people was given civic education a program of national defense was a farce. Dr. Elliott amended by saying that we must add a fourth “R” to ‘readin’, ’ritin’, and ’rithmetic. He would make that fourth “R”

Letters To The Editor
• Finals To the Exponent: As the fatal hour again draws near and finals dominate the thoughts dnd conversation of the entire student body, I’ve been wondering if something can’t be done to remedy one of the most unpleasant situations that arise during these trying times. Reference is to that deplorable state of affairs which compels students, ^ having classes up to the very eve of finals, to plunge into their first 3-hour orgy on the day following the end of regular semester work. Wants Week of Rest Such is not the case in certain other universities, Ohio State for example, where students are given a week’s respite before entering the two most important weeks of their college year. Here, however, there is no calm before the storm and one is literally “tossed to the lions” without a chance for the study necessary to defend himself. Surely this matter can be brought to the attention of the various erstwhile illuminaries who control the fates and destinies of “we who are about to die.” Yours for a breathing spell. Arthur Hunter, ChE. ’44. • Quarter System Dear Sir: In Tuesday’s Exponent there appeared a story describing the overwhelming defeat of a plan {;o place the University on the “Quarters System.” Why were students not given an olficial voice before the faculty vote was taken?

The meeting closed with a short campfire in which the seniors gave some pointers on how the chapter could be of more service to the University. A general outline of work for the coming season was discussed.
the plan has been under consideration for some time, but why has it been kept in the dark? Is the faculty afraid of student opinion ?

Well, the time for the sweet sorrow of parting draws near, thank goodness. The SAE’s are celebrating the coming of finals with their spring formal this Friday night. Their dance along with the Airport Dallce defihitely winds up the Social season for this year. Incidentally, a couple ex-Expon-enteers have gotten together on a pill merger. ^We’re talking about Jim Purcell and Mary Kay Miller. Congratulations, you two. We heard a story today that just about takes the cake for stupidity or something or other. We don’t Jknow what was behind it all, but anyhow. Pi KA Johnny Morrison was seen in the library last weekend on dance night without his jpin girl. Alpha Chi Betty Anderson. Upon inquiry, it was found that he was doing homework for Betty while she had a date with another guy. Johnny knew about it, too, so there must have been something in the wind, but it still sounds awfully silly to us. Don Powers seems to be an awful busy man these days, too. He’s trying to uphold his grades, his senior Exponent job, and Barbara Hass all at the same time. Sounds like a pretty big job to us. Well, people, this is the last weekend ,for tearing around, so make the most of it, and we’ll be seeing you in church on Sunday. L. A. Geupel . ..

Riveters Play Michigan Here Tomorrow Night First Arclight Baseball Game In Big Ten Another milestone in Boilermaker history will go into the archives Friday night at 8:15 p. m. when Dutch Fehring’s baseball team gets together with Michigan, current Big Ten leader, in a first ntght game in Western Conference history at Columbian Park, Lafayette. Students showing passports will be admitted free as in any other home game. Special busses will leave West
Side beginning at 6:45 p. m. and will continue to run until game time. Busses marked KOSSUTH will take students within one block of the park. Gates will open at 7:15 p. m. and the general public may attend for 50, cents including tax. Both teams will begin practice sessions at 6 p. m. and the Riveters will dress in their uniforms at the Pieldhouse and go to the park by bus. Michigan has stipulated that Fehring’s nine must not practice under the lights since the Wolverines will not have that opportunity either. A public address system will aid spectators in following the game. Hawks A Close Second Coach Ray Fisher’s Wolves have a slender lead in the conference and do not wish to jeopardize it, for Iowa’s Hawkeyes are pressing hot on the Michigan trail. Fisher fears that a night game may stymie his team, for the majority of them have never played night ball. However, the same thing may be applied to the Gold and Black—all of which makes it Even-Stephen all the way around. Athletic Directory Mai Elward and Coach Dutch Pehring are responsible for the idea and were primarily interested in making certain
that students could attend the game on their passports. They hope that a large group Will witness the arclight affair. ' » Michigan Versatile Michigan leads the Western Conference in fielding with an imposing .964 average and have only committed 11 errors afield. They rank second behind Wisconsin with a team batting average of .280. The hot and cold Badgers have a cumulative mark of .329. Mickey Stoddard is their leading pitcher with three Wins and 1 defeat. Cliff Wise and a couple Other youngsters give him able support. George HSrms and Dick Wakefield lead the team in the hitting department. The Wolverines have played a schedule definitely fiavored with intersectional tilts. Among their nonconference encounters are Maryland, Washington and Lee, North Carolina, and Wasme. Monday afternoon at 4 p. m, the Riveter Varsity will take on the Prosh on Ross-Ade field. Only varsity sophomores and juniors will play in the annual contest. Two Boilermakers Harry McFer^n and John Emmert continue to lead the Boilermakers in conference competition.

Ray was plabed at-the helm of the 1942 tennis contingent by his teammates yesterday afternoon. During the currently closing season Ray compiled the best singles record of the team, winning 10 of 13 matches. The Hammond athlete played in the number two slot during the season, teaming with retiring Captain Bob Aiiderson to make one of the toughest doubles combinations in the conference. He is known as one of the hardest working players on the team, giving his best under all conditions. Best wishes for a successful year, Ray.

Victors thus far in but three out of their eight meets this season, the Boilermakers have done much to enhance their reputation during the past week by decisively defeating their last two opponents. Riveters Whip Maroons First Wabash, then Chicago bowed to the prowess of the Riveter linksmen. The victory hungry^Boilermakers did one of the most tliorough jobs of the entire Big Ten golf Season when they humbled the Maroons in an almost unheard of 18-0 shutout last Monday. The meet tomorrow will see Bob Hoffer, the only senior on the squ^d, plasnng in his last meet on the home links. Those on the team with another year to go are Wade Enipp, George Dahl, Charlij^ Curran and Doug McDaniel. After tomorrow there will be but one more meet, the battle for the Big Ten Championship next June 18 and 19. Squad Morale Improved It is expected that the squad, heartened by their last two victories, will present a much” better showing in tomorrow’s tilts than they did earlier in the season.
ion Saturday night after the final dual meet of the year with Chicago in Ross-Ade Stadium. All winners of major and minor awards as w^l as numerals wearers will attend this first banquet. Highlighting the evening will be the announcement of the new track captain for 1942.
Riveters Close Tennis Season As a climax to the most successful tennis season in the school’s history, five members of the Riveter net squad will journey to Earlham this afternoon to take part in the annual State Tennis Meet which will continue over tomorrow and Saturday. The preliminaries will occupy most of today and tomorrow leaving Saturday for the final events. During most of the years of it’s existance the meet has been played on the very excellent clay courts at Earlham; last year, however, it was held on the Riveter campus. Lucht Chosen Captain Yesterday afternoon Ray Lucht, number two man on the squad, was chosen next year’s captain by a unanimous vote of his teammates. This year has proved to be an outstanding one for the Hammond, Indiana ace due to his fine average of having won 10 out of his 13 singles matches. Ray paired with Captain Anderson to form the number one doubles team and together they won 11 and lost but 3. Ffve To Make Trip Coach LaBree announced last night that Captain Anderson, Stettner, Armstrong, Captain - elect Lucht and Van Camp will make the trip.^tettner, who was injured last Wednesday in his singles match at DePauw, will be playing with a brace on his knee, so is not expected to be in his usual good form. Winding up four years of excellent service to the Riveter tennis team will be Captain Bob Anderson, number 1 man on this year’s squad. If past records bear* any weight, Bob should make a good account of himself in the meet at Earlham. Fred Richards, the other senior on the squad, will not be able
