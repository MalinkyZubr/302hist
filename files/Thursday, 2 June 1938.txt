ROTC Receives 15th Consecutive ^Excellent^ Rating For the 15th consecutive year the University ROTC corps has received the “excellent” rating, according to a telegram received yesterday by President Elliott. Maj. Gen. W. E. Cole, commander of the Fifth Corps Area, said in the wire, “As a result of annual inspection ROTC unit, Purdue University is again awarded highest rating of excellent. Heartiest congratulations to you, corps of cadets, and regular army personnel of this highly creditable accomplishment.” In only one year since the rating of “distinguished” or “excellent” was established has the University unit failed to achieve the highest rank. The local unit is the largest field artillery unit in America, the entire corps numbering more than 2,600 men. Publication Schedule Two more Exponents will be published this semester.

SAA Announces List Of Athletic Letter Awards
Stratton To Receive Honorary Doctorate Dean of Women Dorothy C. Straton will receive an honorary doctor’s degree from Ottowa University, Ottowa, Kan., at commencement exercises there on June 7th. She will be the first woman to receive an honorary doctorate from this University. Ottowa officials have said that the honor is to be bestowed upon her in recognition of her efficient and outstanding work as a leader among college women. Dean Stratton graduated from Ottowa in 1920. Fire Broke Out. . . ... ill the Alpha Chi Rho fraternity house furnace room last night, drawing some 400 students away from their deep studying to the blaze. No damage was done, except that the house was filled with smoke. Fire department men said, “the boys were doing a fine job of controlling the fire when we arrived, and could have extinguished it with ease.” Hot ashes on some kindling wood near a hot water heater were suspected as origin of the fire. This fire was the second in the Alpha Chi Rho house. The first, in 1931, started in a similar manner and completely destroyed the house.
FINAL EXAM NOTICE Check the final examination schedule again to be sure that you have noted the proper time and place of your finals. Failure to understand the schedule sheet is not sufficient cause to warrant a second examination. Absence from a final will necessitate the recording of a failing grade in that course. M. L. FISHER, Dean of Men.
Board Approves 145 Varsity, Frosh Insignia For Spring Sports, Managers, Yell Leaders, SAA
I

A total of 145 insignia were authorized including nine freshman varsity numerals in football which were awarded to yearlings who did not win their numerals last fall but displayed sufficient promise during spring
football drill.
I" In making the freshman baseball
awards it was announced that additional awards would be authorized following next fall’s practice, providing the development of candidates who did not win the award this spring justified the recognition.

Buckles, Mason Announce Book Exchange Plans As the school year neai-s its end, members of the new Student Book Exchange Board are completing plans for the second exchange, to be held in the Union ballroom during and after registration next fall, according to announcement by Publicity Director R. A. Buckles last
night.
Board Chairman Sully Mason had the following statement to make concerning the exchange when con-
tacted:
“The success of the Book Exchange next fall will depend entirely upon the promptness with which old students register their used books to be sold. Since this year’s graduating seniors will not be back to leave their books with the Exchange, and there will be nearly two thousand new freshmen clamoring to buy books, there is every indication that the demand for the books at the opening of school may exceed the Exchange supply. “For this reason I wish to remind all students thatjthey can set their own prices on used books and collect the full sale price when''their books are sold by the Exchange.”
Indiana Weather
Forecast for Indiana: Generally fair today. Fair and warmer to-
morrow.
Semester Final Examination Schedule Through Saturday
The examination will be taken only at the time indicated in the schedule except in case of conflicts for irregular students. Any such conflicts must be adjusted by consultation with the instructor in charge before the opening of examinations. Examination periods for graduate courses should be arranged with instructor if they are not scheduled. *Examinations will be held in the same rooms in which the divisions regularly recite.

Student Honesty...
. beconiGS incvGasnigly sig'iiificant now that the campus is in the midst of the final examination period.
Cases of cheating or answer copying discovered these last few days would be one of the few things that could mar the atmosphere of happiness and satisfaction that will accompany the completion of the school
year.
Honesty will bring its ovm reward to the student in many ways . . . just as dishonesty, even if undiscovered, often deals its own punishment. We’ve known several cases where the cheater came to grief almost immediately, and many cases where the difficulty came later when the student was called upon to know material he had let slip by—material he had merely “borrowed” for use on an exam paper. We once saw a fairly good student flunk a test because he tried to “check” his answers with a friend during a test. He spent so much time trying to read answers upside down that he never finished his own work. More ludicrous was the case of a student who stole over a hundred answers in an economics truefalse and copied them down after the wrong questions. In a large number of courses, especially those where grades are given according to a curve, the person who gives information hurts himself and everyone else in the class. It doesn’t seem logical that the doubtful satisfaction gained from “putting one over on the teacher” should outweigh this concrete disadvantage . . . and the engineers at least should go in for logic in a serious way.
It Would Take A Long Time...
. . . for any enterprising cadet corps to beat the record our University ROTC unit has established. Another accomplishment has been added to the string this year, for just yesterday President Elliott received a congratulatory telegram announcing that Purdue’s cadets have for the fifteenth consecutive year won the highest rating at their national inspection.
Male Pride May Suffer...
. . . but we couldn’t pass by this “quotable quote” from Associated Collegiate Press releases: “The Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority softball team

YET SOMEONE insists on calling for DEAN at the wrong place. What have you been telling your friends, Dean?
“HARVARD DAY” was observed last week by the Acacias in honor of one of the brothers who is planning to attend the Eastern institution next year. No “r’s” were heard in the house during the entire day.
THERE HAVE BEEN various methods mentioned around here on how to prepare for finals, so we will give you our’s^—take it or leave it.

History, Economics Faculty Golf Team Wins Tournament Faculty golf enthusiasts finished their annual tournament over the past week-end with the history and economics department defeating the mechanical engineering team in the final match. W. V. Owen ,and C. J. Martin of the- history and economics department team defeated H. G. Venemann ajid G. A. Young respectively of the ME department. Since there were only three matches to be contested and the history department won the first two, there was no need to play the match between C. W. Messersmith, ME, and A. F. Messenger, history and economics professor. Three teams competed in the tournament but physical education was eliminated in the qualifying round.
Morse Captures All-Campus Tennis Title From Powell Dan Morse, Beta Theta Pi senior, added the all-campus tennis crown to .his titles when he defeated Jap Powell, freshman engineer, 6-3, 6-1, 6-0 Tuesday afternoon on the University courts in the final match. Morse was a member of the Beta doubles team which won the fraternity tournament last week. He will play Bob Anderson, promising frosh tennis man, in the final match of the fraternity singles tournament Saturday. Anderson showed some fine tennis in the freshmanvarsity matches when he forced Fuente, number one man on the varsity, to two extra game sets before falling.
