Dr. Robert Wicks Will Speak At Regular Monthly Religious Convocation Sunday
Dr. Robert Russell Wicks, dean of the Princeton UniversityChapel, will speak Sunday morning in Eliza Fowler Hall at the regular January convocation for worship. Though Dr. Wicks is widely known as an educator, author, and lecturer; he has gained greater renown for his broad religious training.
While serving in his capacity as
dean of the Princeton Chapel, a position which he has held since 1929, Dr. Wicks has been closely associated with (Students and the many problems peculiar to student life. These almost intimate associations with Princeton students have given him valuable experiences that have expanded his appreciation and understanding of student life in general. Annually a number of colleges and universities request Dr. Wick to appear on their lecture and convocation programs, where he spends three to four days in conference with troubled students. Among institutions making such request are: Vassar, University of Virginia, University of North Carolina, Vanderbilt University, and Ohio Wesleyan University, He used experiences and inspirations growing out of these conferences as a basis for the book he published, which' is entitled “The Reason For Living.” His latest book, “One Generation and Another,” was recently released by the Scribner Press. Union Club Doubles Residential Quarter Forty faculty members and graduate students may be accommodated this coming semester in the enlarged Memorial union residential quarters. The maximum number of twenty permanent guest rooms has been doubled to better accommodate requests for rooms by the semester. A large number of these rooms are yet available and may be reserved by application at the manager’s office in the Union.
Current Engineer Features Three R's Rivaling the University’s famed three “B’s” the current issue of the Purdue Engineer, which will be distributed Friday, will feature the three “R’s”—rubber, rockets and rolled eai’th dams. To keep students in the cold— referring to the weather of course —for the final period, the cover will depict the clearing of a Cascade Mountain pass by a snowplow. An article titled “Rockets” deals with the latest developments in this transportation method of the future. Neoprene and Thiokol as the synthetic products that revolutionized the rubber industry form the basis for "the second of the featured articles. The advantages and adaptability of the rolled earth dams as the cheapest in the world completes the “R” list. Other articles contained in the issue will cover glass protection and the timely topic titled “Wanted: Seniors.” The regular “Sidelights” an(f “Campus Highlights” are also included. Elward To Speak In Gary Emerson high school eleven will hear Mai Elward, head football coach, tonight at a dinner banquet, given by the school officials. Mai, who has been traveling for after dinner speeches for the last two months, will leave for Gary today. He will be accompanied by Joe Mihal, member of the freshman football coaching staff, and former University star.
Nine CAA Students Qualify For New Training Course Nine University students who completed the private pilot training course sponsored by the Civil Aeronautics Authority here last spring have been nominated for the experimental advanced civilian pilot training program which the CAA expects to launch at the University in the near future, it was announced yesterday by G. Stanley Meikle, director of research relations with in-
dustry.
I Training in the advanced course will include between 40 to 50 hours in 125 horsepower planes for each participant. Although CAA has no official connection with army training, those who complete the course will be qualified to take basic training at Randolph field. Students nominated for the course who are expected to report to Director Meikle this morning to fill out formal applications are as follows: Stanley Best, Robert Moninger, James Ashton, Christopher Reismg, Kenneth Murdock, Lloyd Treece, Richard Kimball, Fred Mayfield^ and George Henderson. Student Pastors Will Entertain Ag Guests Members of the Agricultuial Short Courses will be guests at a party, given by the Purdue Protestant groups lead by Student Pastors, Friday evening, at 7:30 in the West Lafayette Methodist Church. Rev. Hubert Reynolds of the Christian Church, assisted by Rev. J. B. Gleason and the Baptist group, will present the entertainment. All rjegular members of the Purdue Foundations are requested to attend to help enteitain the guests.
Pest Exterminators See Demonstration Of Control Methods Practical demonstrations of methods of exterminating various types of household pests provided the highlights of yesterday’s program for the fourth annual Pest Control Operators Conference now in session at the University. Attracting some 125 speciali^s from 20 states and provinces of Canada, the conference morning session opened the day’s activities with a demonstration of the reactions of rats to specific poisons. Chief demonstrator was C. R. Sturtevane, Buffalo, N. Y. Later in the morning George Hockenyos, Springfield, 111., explained the chemistry of arsenical soil insecticides. G. E. Gould, of the University staff, described biological studies of cockroaches and sources of infestation. Control Procedures Other features of the morning program were practical control procedures as explained by Chester Schwimmer, Jamaica, N. Y. Recent studies on the mechanical performance of various types of hand sprayers were demonstrated by F. L. Campbell, instructor at Ohio State. To cloSfe the morning session Prof. J. J. Davis, head of the University entomology department, discussed findings in regard to the brown dog tick. Afternoon activities featured a field tiip in which the operators inspected various types of construction designed to control termites as well as termite infested sites. Special pictures of termite infestation and control measures were shown last night. Exponent Staff Exponent staff for Thursday night is as follows: Purcell, issue editor; | Ochiltree, proof; Skallerup, worker; Wiess, worker.
port by President E. C, Elliott, in which is included the action on a variety of subjects by the Board of Trustees, a statement on legislation, and revenue and expenditures for a 15 year period, the 382 page volume carries statements of other administrative officers of the University, the various schools and departments, many faculty committees, and the principal directed student projects. Among other things the report contains various tables on enrollment, number of graduates, enrollment by states and countries, finances, etc.' 18,243 Graduate So Far One table reveals that enrollment has gone from 2,955 in 1919-20 to 8,243 different students in the past academic year; another that the number of graduates up to and including last June totaled 18,243 and a total of 2,090 advanced or honorary degrees have been conferred during the life of the University. The report lists among many other things, also the physical pla^it growth of the University, including buildings under construction and work of the previous five years which was made possible by federal aid. The Three Big Ones « President Elliott in his statement reveals that three principal problems confront the University as follows: Overpopulation and underpreparation of students. Overinstruction and underteaching. Overproduction and underplacement of graduates.
After pointing out University efforts to solve these, he concludes with this significant statement: Elliott Says: “By and large, economic society must support education, and those educated must be fitted for places in that society.^ It is well that the University recognizes the imwritteu as well as the written Bill of Rights of youth. But youth, after education, must eat, and therefore must be qualified for a productive place in the existing economy.” Data on each school in the University, together with the activities of the teaching staff, the projects underway in research and extension activities are reviewed in the reports by the deans of the several schools that compose the University. Of particular interest is the report on the research relations with industry and the Purdue Reeearch Foundation which has broadened the extensive programs of research in agriculture, industry and science. Health Service Report Of more than passing interest was the report on the Student Health Service for the year, showing that the regularly enrolled students made 90,939 calls during the year to the health service not only to get well when they were ill but to keep well. The services given by the health service included 7,385 physical examinations, 5,564 tubercuolsis examinations, countless calls for such things as sore throats, colds, tests for many ailments, inoculations, vaccinations, etc.

A bit fiom the Oklahoma Daily about the man who was collecting, indexing, and numbeimg all of the jokes told by University professors strikes us as one of the most valuable bits of work of the current year. After he gets it compiled the little man who is doing all the woik will turn it ovei to the University. Then professors can quote the number of the joke instead of rambling through it. Think of all the time it will save—to say nothing of the agony it will spare the stu-
dents.
—c-c— Times certainly do change—the students of Gustavus Adolphus College received the following notice “Don’t appear to be a helpless and fragile creature. The ‘clinging rine type’ went with the bicycle built for two.” While we aie on the subject of clinging vines we might as well pass on the results of the suivey conducted by Di W. C Donald at the University of Califoinia Di Donold reports that this generation of college men is tallei, heaviei, and rangier than those of the last generation But, says he, the college w^oman is keeping pace with the change with moie altitude, wider shoulders, naiiow'er hips Bung on the feetball!! Politicians aie always getting blamed for things but the edit^oi of the Wheaton College Record wrote a new one on the record when he received the following note, “Deal Editor • (You Democrat) • We never froze at homecoming when Coolidge and Hoover were presidents ” Maybe we should Write to F. D. R. or Jim Farley about more home football games! —c c— In the future Dr Richard J Weinei president of Salma Junior College, isn’t going to be as i eady with his criticism of student conduct It seems the other day three students called on him to recovei a lost article He reached into the lost and found drawer of his desk and began, “Just look at these car keys left here It’s a sure thing no one can do without them And yet they are left here for days” Then he began to stammer “Why these can’t be my car keys, can they‘d By golly, they aie ” The students left without another word. And incidentally without what they came for. —c-c— Vague rumors that this is Leap Year have reached us, but the only definite indications of it that we have heard of was the sign reading, “No dogs allowed” that the girls in residence halls at Minnesota hung on the door Downright unkind we call it. —c c-— The Ball State News crashed through with a number of good ci acks—anyway we liked them DEFINITION? Drainage—an organized diip. We Like It! Beer is like the sun—it rises in the yeast and sets in the vest College is a place where “Orchids to you” is just another saying These Freshmen! Once upon a time ^ freshman coed wanted to know if a neckerchief was the head of a soioiity.

Spring is in the air as far as fashion is concerned, co-eds, and it’s time that we of the fairer sex started thinking about the new styles, so here we are bringing you a forecast of the 1940 spring fash-
ions.
Hats, the bane of a man’s life (outside of women) are going to be quite something. All colors will be fashionable and it is predicted that any combination will be acceptable. High crowns, low crowns, pill-boxes, and turbans will be worn. Particularly good along the color line will be lavenders, dusty pinks, and yellows.
Jacket suits will be seen in the Easter Parade along wrth punted silk dresses and femrmne styled coats By the by, grrls, it’s stylish to be very feminine this year As usual, black and white crepe and chiffon will be worn Old fashioned sleeves ai e coming back with plenty of shirring
Of course you’re always interested in formats and when prom does come around one might as well be prepared. In the formal line full-skirted chiffons and organdies will be displayed. Tiimmings such as bows, ribbons, flowers, and maybe even fans will provide the decorations. It is predicted that puffed sleeves will predominate.
One of the best ways to brighten your outlook is to do a little prelUbh spring shopping and invest in a light, pleated skirt with contrasting jacket At least, you can try dropping a gentle hint in the letter home Blue Demons Defeat 31 Teams To Take Bowling Tournament Climaxing a chain of victories that proved them superior to 31 to 31 other teams entered in the all campus men’s bowling tournament sponsored by Student Union, the Blue Demons last night defeated Cary Hall South on the Union alleys The champions, as well as the Cary Hall South team, will each receive a key In addition the name of the winning team will be insciibed on a plaque which will be hung in the bowling alleys Membeis of the Blue Demon Team are Alexander, Hussey, Murray, Menten, and Bunting Members of the Cary Hall team are Aulson, Himes, Wood, Weichel, and Baines

Yes sirree, times have really changed and we moderns are quite modem in conti’ast to the good old days when the neighbors gossiped over the fence about the daring young visitor who was so bold as to be seen riding side-saddle through the mam street. Time was when all the women’s gym classes did was swing a few Indian clubs aioupd. It seems the reason no more energetic activity than this was indulged in was that the ladies were so burdened down with clothes — bloomers below the knees, sailoi blouse middies, blue scaifs, and heavens knows what undei all this, that they weie unable to be moie strenuous. t-n Nowadays the modems dash aiound in shorts and bandanas and indulge in all the spoits, even invading piecious male terntoiy. Any visitoi now wandering into a women’s gym class will find students playing ping-pong, golf, swimming, dancing to modern stiains, bowling, etc , etc , far into the night But turning back the pages, we would have seen the young damsels engaged id doing folk dances to the tune of ‘‘Tuikey m the Straw,” oi smacking the elusive little croquet ball aiound at a teriific speed Speaking of dancing to modem strains some of oiu moie conseivative citizens might be a bit on the shocked side on viewing the skm tight jeisey modem dance costumes that leave no contours to the nnagrnation t-n All the modern mrss has to do rs roll up a towel and bathing suit in a rubbei cap and dash off fo the beach foi a cooling dip of a lookaiound, but not so the miss of the “gay 90’s ” She woie voluminous skirts, long black silk stockings, complete-coverage blouses, and even scaifs Fines weie imposed on those biazen young ladies who failed to comply with modesty’s demands Need we elucidate on the costumes of today’ t-n You may lave and lant about the good old days but we’ll take the modem and the moie the bettei Stratton Addresses WRH “How to Study foi Finals” was the subject of a talk given last night befoie the membeis of the Women’s Residence Hall Club by Doiothy C Stiatton, dean of women Dean Stiatton’s talk is an annual affaii sponsoied by the lesidence halls to aid the giils m studying foi finals

Their Jbtal of 60 j|oints against the Gophers is the highest scorh run up so far„in the conference.play and their; total of 188 points for the four games is also tops. Defensively they are also leading as the opponents have been able to score only 131 points against the stordy Riveter defense lead by Beretta, Yeager, Tierney and company. The Big Ten leadership is a risky place te be, though, as bfher teams seem to get a great joy at knocking the leaders off, as Indiana and Mie^gan will willingly - testify. These two teams, incidentally, are still at the dpor, waiting for ^yard’s charges to come back out apd play after, finals, are over, and Indiana gets first chance as the Riveters must invade Bloomington in their next game on February fO.
Hoosiers Beaten Just Once A last second rpsh. by Minnesota was ail that gave fbe Hoosiers their only .defeat of, the season so apd ih. appears ^ thnt ■ th® ^honee series between the two state schools will be one qf the deciding factors in, the Big .Tflen race. The , Hopsiers had a. little trouble Monday against WisconsifT as the Badgers kept even with. them fpr the first half due to some fine work by Englund, but refused tp be beaten twice in a row aiid pulled ahead in the second half to win 42-34. Michigan’s first loss in conference' play was almost entirely due to the superb playing of Bill Hapac who scored 20 points for the Illinl as they downed the Wolverines, 4843. Michigan had previously beaten Ohio State, Wisconsin and Iowa.

Riveter Grapplers Prepare To Flatten FutureOpponents There are all kinds of activity up in the wrestling room on the second floor of the Fieldhouse these days. . . . Occasion? The boys are hard at work grooming themselves to knock the grunts out of as tough a schedule of matmen as the Boilermaker squad has had to face in many a season. The Big Ten season was to haye opened last Saturday, Jan. 13, with the Gold and Black traveling up to Madison to step upon the mat pitted against the Badgers. The meet had to be postponed until the 26th . of this month, however, because of an epidemic of mumps (what next!) on the Wisconsin campus. Purdue is now scheduled to open its wrestling schedule on home territory, wheh'^the squad meets Illinois Normal in the Fieldhouse gymnasium
on Saturday, February 3, and the Bloomington boys are expected to stretch the Boilei’inaker squad the limit. Illinois Normal leader. Captain Sperry, Should be bad medicine for whoever is scheduled to represent/the Riveters in the 136 pound class, and if Howie Timmons, 136 pound Boilermaker, is selected to take care of Sperry, that match will probably be one of the best of the evening. Timmorts is a three year varsity man who showed up very well in last year’s competitions. Purdue Lads Capable Other dangerous mien invading the Fieldhouse on February third are Switzer, Russell and Wright. All'three men^won their matches in a recent competition with Wisconsin, and ai’e primed to put up scraps deluxe. Representing Pui’due in the 121 pound class will be Bob Safford. This is Bob’s first year as a varsity wrestler and the Illinois Normal meet will be his second varsity appearance, so he is out there to win. In the 128 pound division is Fredricks, with a record of one victory already chalked up for him this year. Fredricks is only a sophomore, but his showing against MidWestern AAU marks him as one of the most dangerous men on the Boilermaker squad. Moving up to the 146 pounders, we find Papurca capably filling the bill. Papurca is a junior with an enviable record chalked up in last season’s contests.

During the periodic Jull that usually deacends ui^n the campus around this tipie of year-—more pj* less of a s^itplastic ''blitzkrieg”—-one of tjhe few places, that teems with that elusive bit of stuff known as “epergy” is a large brick building fliat huddles around the basketball floor. To the incomifig freshmen we nonchalantly call it “The Fieldhouse.”
Confucius Still Talking
In between moving a book from one side of your desk to the other, so that there is more room in which to write letters, you and your fellow sufferers can trot on over to the athletic emporium and forget about finals along with the P E students. This can be done with little or no bothering of the conscience because as Confucius once put it, “man who sits on tack is better off.” (We just had to get one of those on the sports
page).
As there is a good quantity of water in the swimming pool it has been suggested as an excellent place in which to drown scholastic sorrows. Last year during finals only the main gym managed to pile > up a bigger gathering than the pool and that was probably because of the fact the surface of the liquid became so full of floating eds that few would-be swimmers cared to venture in and spend the afternoon xmder water. Squash Courts Standing The squash courts will be standing as usual, and a goodly supply of those little round squash balls will be available for those who feel strong enough to chase themselves around the enclosures. Down in the basement, archery and golf Will be going on as usual although there is some fear that finals will prove a bit too much for some of the less patient golfers who like to take their troubles out on the innocent little white pellets. However,' the place hqs been sound-proofed and a few extra stitches taken in the canvas targets. The wrestling and boxing rooms will also be open fox* any of those who go in for the more strenuous type of relaxation. Along with the grunters and pugilists, the racquet swinging tennis and badminton players will find plenty of room in which to get away fi’om it all. Anyhow as one freshman was heard to remark, “I may as well go over to the gym now because after finals I may not be here to use it.”
By Robert J. Dedcard Remember back in 1936 when the Boilermaker basketball brigade ' headed by the Bob Kessler - Jewel Young - Johnny Sines forward combination rung up a new Big Ten conference record by scoring 612 points in one season?
—^fc—■
Well, chums, that same record this very season is being jeopardized by another Boilermaker outfit/this time being headed by Fisher, Igney, Sprowl, Blanken, Beretta, Tierney, Yeager, and numerous other Riveter basketteers.
—:f C—
As of to date, the Boilermaker net squad has whiffed the draperies to the tune of 188 points, or an average of 47 points per game . . . The mean of the record hung up in ’36 amounted to approximately 43
points.
—fc— . The Boilermakiers in their first semester activities have accounted for 516 points against their opponents’ 386 ... This means that Coach Piggy Lambert’s charges have averaged 43 points per game, including all pre-conference games . . . The Boilermakers have garnered 10 games, and gone down twice. ‘ — Many a time Boilermaker followers have almost cracked a blood vessel, yelling for the Lambertnien to score at least 50 points during a game . . . Twice the Riveters have done it, once against Rice with 52 and dnee against Minnesota with
50.
—. ■,; Twice the Riveters hit 49, once 48, and once 47 . .. The lowest score made by the Boilermakers was in ** the DePaul game, in which they negotiated 25 against DePaul’s 37.

Indiana Politics
But
Incidentally— J
By yiadimir
are still pretty much of an unknown quantity to us, and we have never made any claims, editorially or otherwise, that we were intimately conversant with political strategy and knew just exactly what went on behind the statehouse walls. The rumor that President Edward C. Elliott was being touted as a democratic nominee for governor left us somewhat cold. Not that we doubted Dr. Elliott’s ability, but because we hoped his love for Purdue would keep him here in the Executive Building, and because we felt that with his educational background he could do more for the people of Indiana as president of Purdue than as governor. True, it may be advantageous for the president of any state university to be on friendly terms with the state legislature when the school’s annual appropriation is about to be passed. However, we are opposed to excessive mixing of education with politics. Previous experience has shown that in many cases the two do not make a happy combination. Therefore, we were glad to read this statement from Dr. Elliott in answer to the newspaper story of his tentative candidacy: “I have never been, and I am not now, a candidate for any political office whatever. While not unmindful of the recently expressed favorable opinions of my friends, I am convinced that my best public service can be rendered by continuing to devote myself exclusively to the all important work of the university. I hope that there will be no further efforts to divert me from the educational things I know how to do to the political things for which I am not adapted.”
REFEREES Personally, we hate referees. Especially the type of referees who officiate at Purdue home basketball games. Why, we hate referees almost as much as we hate co-eds who don’t realize that this is Leap Year.
It’s always so apparent that the crowd is right (7,000 excuses for NOT being wrong) we would like to change all that. Our research experts have probed to the heart of the problem and given us the solution.
At the next game we aie saving the two seats next to us for the REFEREES.
There’s no excuse for making mistakes from the stands.
We agree most heartily. President Elliott, and hope that many more generations of Boilermakers will find you still working for the good of Purdue University as you have in the past.
Honor, Honesty...
It All Depends
was the title of the little orange-covered leaflet which was distributed to all students several months ago. This booklet was a concrete effort by the Committee on Promotion of Honesty in Student Work and Dr. Elliott to combat Purdue Public Enemy Number “N” . . . dishonesty in any of its manifold forms.
... on how you look at this state of being “smart.” Yesterday, while walking being a group of three students, we heard this provocative statement, “She isn’t really smart, she just studies all the time.”
We hope no personal characters will fall down during final examinations this year, however great the temptation may be. Maximum penalty for dishonesty is suspension from the University, and minimum penalty is a grade of “D” in the course involved. ^
There aren’t very many of us that could pass a college entrance exam the day we were born, nor does the school of hard knocks teach one much about calculus. If neither birth nor the school of hard knocks will teach us how to intion arises as to whether final examinations are a fair method of determining a students’ knowledge of a course. Pro’s have it that there IS no incentive to study during the year. Con’s say that a student working his way through school or interested in activities should have a final chance to pass a course although he does not give sufficient time to the course during the semester.
Weigh the loss in personal honor and the possible results before you attempt to crib on any of your examinations. Then w^e’re certain you’ll play the game square.
We still favor final examinations as a sum-ming-up of the course. It gives a student that last chance to pull himself up by the “bootstraps.” And to those lucky students who do not fear course, instructor, or final exam, we say, “Maybe I should have studied too?” The rest o fus still think we still have one last chance to make a better grade. — R.

As far as -we’re concerned, those guys in the green or striped shirts make a hobby of breeding hate. From way up in the last row, the spectators at the Minnesota game could see the blue haze in the air when Piggy grabbed the referee by the arm.
Mr. S. G. Mittlestaedt of the pharmacy school, graduate studePt and instructor, has pushed his i>in out on Miss Daisy Brewer, graduate of this University. This is a good example of an intelligent romance, what?

Those who know say that there is some question as to just who felt worst about the incident.
But the referee looked mighty UNHAPPY. And he called a foul in no uncertain terms. We’d even go so far as to say that his face was purple—but that might have been a blue orchid that some Purdue rooter tossed him.
We often wonder just how a refeiee feels when he calls a foul, loudly, as they always do, and then hears 7,000 people tell him “No”—^with embellishments.
At this point we would like to dedicate a song to the beaten men of the courts, it’s “If I Knew Then What I Know Now.”
But we must admit that the referees are most usually wrong—^the odds are against them. We’ve even called a few ourselves that the officials bogged down
—B & B— . . while Eli Yeager, local boy and Jane Ostrander, local girl, still beat around the bush, casting soft glances this way and that, but mostly at each other. We can’t say how serious this budded romance is, but we think they make a nice couple.. —B & “Piggy” Lambert will probably be on my neck for giving his boys publicity (afraid it might go to their heads, and that can spoil our superior team). Anyway, everybody can’t help noticing how all the coeds stare at Mickey Tierney when he gets on the floor. They ooooooh and aaahh something terrible, and a certain co-ed, name unknown, is said to be so ga-ga over him that she prays for him every night before a game ... she’s a freshman .. —B & B— The youngei of the Jenkms boys, Gordon, has been seen galavantm’ around with a very cute blonde from across the liver. It’s tough that you can’t find a co-ed to m^et your lequirements, Gordon, but confidentially, I’d stick to the blonde —B & B—
Dear Bull, We read (we can, you know) a letter that appeared yesteiday in this same column concerning a criticism about a Purdue Queen feature. Ml R S. E ’42, whoever he is, states that the author of the article seems to be opposed to moie queens When we read the article we got the impression that this opinion was the opinion of other students and not that of the author Checking the article again, we could find no place wheie the author stated that she, peisonally, was against more queens The opinion m the feature, we believe, was the opinion of othei s written only to show ideas voiced by students on the campus J C.
