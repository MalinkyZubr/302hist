The Sigma Delta Chi Leather Medial Award On the right hand side ef the doorway room 2i2 of the Union, just across from the ^ast Desk, hangs the recofd of the second "^d oldest of the Sigma jDelta Ghi ^nual ^awards, The Leather* Medal. The medal is awarded annually to a man who has made a distihctive contribution to the welfare, success, and reputation of the University. Add hanging from the brown leather 0(Jtagoii base are the^ names of twenty-^four men who have contributed to the welfare, suceass, and reputation of the school, Now ;SDX is preparing to select the twenty-fifth name for The Leather Medal AwaM. It might be best to look back and see what 'those inen did contribute 'to the Umversity. 'The man. who received the first honor was V Stanley Coulter, then Dean of Men. That was in 1921, and in 1937 another Dean of Men, i|e^ was narried for the award.
