Ha^od Wm Speak Here Thursdiay Gradiiate To Give Final Employment Lecture In Eliza Fo wler Hall “'Piilaing Employment” and then a discussion of the ups and downs after' obtaining that employment describes briefly the final subject of the employment lecture series to be given at 4 o’clock Thursday afternoon with Clifford L. Harrod, former president of the Indianapolis Power and Light Company, as the speaker. Harrod, a 1911 graduate in electrical engineering, will speak in Eliza Fowler Hall, and his lecture will be preceded by a set of motion pictures in color which he made recently while on a trip to South America. The picture will be used as part of his lecture on employment. Prof. F. C. Hockema, assistant to the president, and head of the committee jn charge of the lectures stated. Career Following his graduation from the University Mr. Harrod spent the next three years as an apprentice with the Pennsylvania Raiilroad. During this apprenticeship, his work-was called to the attention of the railroad executives because of the use he had made of a movie camera in obtaining permanent records of accidents. This initiative won for him a position as foreman, a post he gave up to enlist in the engineers’ corps for serv ice in the World War. Harrod was made a captain but at the end of the war joined the staff of the Public Service Commission. In 1921 he gave UP his post to become consulting engineer for the Indiana Coal Operators’ Association, and in 1927 was named manager and then president of the Indianapolis Power and Light. Only recently he retired from that post to devote his entire time to i his consulting practice in which he' has made a wide reputation. Harrod has spoken each of the last several years t6 the seniors on employment or some phase of selling their services, and his coming to the campus again indicates the high esteem in which he is held by his hearers of past years. The lecture Thursday will be primarily for seniors but it is open to any student or staff member, and a large attendance is expected.
Purdue Entries Place Second In Flower Show Entries made by University flchucultural students in the national flower show at Baltimore^ placed second in the collegiate class according to h telegram received yesterday :from Prof. E.

Style Show Hop Not Co-ed Bid Dance in contrast to previous years the annual Co-ed Bid Formal, which is accompanied by the Union style show, will riot be a co-ed bid dance this year, according to an announcement by Jack Ohaver, Union vice president, last night. Since the Gold Peppers’ dance, which is a co-ed bid affair, is being held this Friday and the style show and the dance is scheduled for the following Friday, March 27, it was decided to make the latter a regular dance. Last year’s dance was of the cabaret style with tables around the floor and favors and souvenirs for each couple. The highlight of the evening was the style show for which Loeb and Hene an^ Palais Royal furnished the costumes.
Dr. DavisTalks At Final Convo Erie Pastor Urges. Audience To ‘‘Rejoice In Comrade’s Success” Speaking in behalf of the fellow who stays at home, who abstains from the pleasures which are beyond his reach as soon as his money is gone, the Reverend Ralph Marshall Davis, pastor of the Church of the Cove^nt, Erie, Pa., addressed the final religious convocation at which an outside speaker will preside this semester in Eliza Fowler Hall Sunday morning. His subject was “On Being Kind to the
Fortunate”.
Following his introduction by Pres, E. 0. Elliott, Dr, Davis read scripture concerning the Prodical Son. With this story as the theme for his talk, he said, “I hope that out of you students Will arise a new art of Christianity that will give due weight to the fellow who did stay at home.” .Suspicious Success “The successful man is considered a suspicious character,” stated Dr. Davis. “If a man is at all successful he is Certain to be accused of being dishonest.” He urged the audience to “rejoice in your comrade’s success, feven if it be greater,
than yours.”
Questioned about the University in Pres. Elliott’s office following the convocation. Dr. Davis said, “Oh, I’m in love with it. I haven’t been very weU acquainted with dts inner workings during the past few years but I always keep in touch with its president. And I can say that you have the greatest president in the country. It’s always safe to say that,” he added with a smiling glance toward Pres. Elliott.
Extraordinary
“You have an extraordinary group of students here,” he said, “They are remarkably free from the wastrel and sophisticate. And 1 especially like the spirit of cooperation with which they enter into these meetings.’’ The University choir, under the direction of Albert P. Stewart, sang several hymns and choral amens. J. R. Hammond, E, E. ’36, accompanied the group at the organ. Charlotte Stewart sang the solo part in “Inflammatus est, from Stabat Mater”, by Rossini. ^
Pots Early Today Freshmen Feed Blaze With Administration .■Beildipg Ltimber L\miber from the Administration Building and freshman pots went up in smoke early this morning When approximately 200 freshmen raUied arourid a bonfire on Stuart Field at 1:30 o’clock for the anriual pot burning ceremony. Green Potters, who engineered the affair, announced to the world last night that they would burn their green caps tonight, but secretly called up as many first-year men as they could and staged the rite a little earlier. Five cars loaded vrith frosh Went to the Alpha Tau Omega house early this morning, where they aroused the sleepers with their shouts and broke a nunibeir of windows. The group then started for the Phi Delta Theta house, but apparently reconsidered and turned
back.
Challenge Questioned last night. Beta Edwards, vice president of Green Potters, who said he was speaking for a group “representative of the entire freshman class”, challenged the sophomores with the statement, “We think the sophomores are a big bunch of sissies and we are out for anything they have. We are out for blood and don’t think the sophs can take it.” But despite this confident inSplt, the Potters probably decided that it would be safer to hold the festivities early this morning, and made -arrangement accordingly. Go-eds T® Hear Marriage Talk By Dr. Wheeler Dr. Theodora Wheeler will address senior co-eds Thursday evening at 10:30 in the women’s lounge on the subject, ‘"rhe Hygiene of Marriage”. Dr. Wheeler was scheduled tp, speak last week but was unable to do so because of the illness of her daughter. Pi Phi Pledge’s Auto Brings More Grief That green Oldsmobile which figured so prominently in the recent arrest of Ruth Moore, Pi Beta Phi, yesterday brought grief to Blanche Kernel, its ovmer, who is also affiliated with that sorority. She was assessed one dollar for violation of a city traffic ordinance. Others connected with the University who were fined as a result of the police drive were Paul BroWn, James Campbell, Vivian Thomas, and Palmer Edgerton.

Cmrmiia^^ Pr&ms SpmrMimg Pr&dmetmn Before Large Crowds By Hugh'Forster.
Sparkling wit, colorful costumes, and rollicking dance routines featured “Carmita”, third annual Student Union show, presented Saturday afternoon and night before capacity crowds in the Mars Theatre. The show developed into a race between Fred Ahrens, playing the comedy lead, and the “Pony” chorus to see which would gallop off with first honors. Ahren’s facial expressions and inspired enthusiasm gave his performance a professional quality. Mary Jean Light, playing the part of a vicious brat, teamed with him for numerous uproarious scenes. S. J. Martinez, as Prof. G. Droolspool Spelvin, an absent-minded, henpecked geologist, played his pari to perfection. Virginia Meguiar, as the professor’s overbearing wife, also deserves credit. Ahrens, Light, Martinez and Meguiar, when on the stage at the same time, made up a comedy team that would do credit to any professional company. Ghost Thrills ^he flimsy plot, built around a western dude ranch and mysterious Mexican “Ghost Rider” bandits, nevertheless, provided an adequate foundation for excellent singing and dancing entertainment. Most
of the singing was provided by W. R. Shuttleworth, owner of the dude ranch, and Mary Friend, the beautiful Spanish “Carmita”. Other singing and speaking parts were well handled by Fritzi Walkey, Louise Hanley, Ruth Grimm, and J. F. Brubaker. Karl Mueller made a convincing villairi with Spanish accent and menacing mien. George Claypool, E. S. Wright and H. Brennan completed an excellent
east.
“Pony” Chorus The “Pony” chorus received roars of applause each time it made an appearance. The dance routines arranged and directed by Betty Ann Plorer -were performed with preci sion. Specialty dances by Jane Allen, Marian Pearheiley, Louise Burkle, Bill Upton, Elizabeth Hayes and Francisco Trapaga provided interesting interludes. “Carmita’’ by far the best of the Student Union productions, reflected the work of Albert P^ Stewart; who directed the music, and H Kenn Carmichael, who supervised the action. The addition of glee dub singers to the cast and choruses made excellent singing a part of the show. The production rivaled the “Harlequin Club” shows of former years.

6.5 Students
Tell Herw They Do lt
Prom a group of 4,700 students at the University nine stand outi stand out from all the rest—nine superintellectuals, nine studente with 6.5 scholastic indexes. Let us take a glimpse at these nine mental giants, or, better still, let them speak for themselves. How does it feel to make the distinguished ratirig> how it is done, what do these nine think about the highest scholastic honor which the University
confers?
K. H. Burrell, E. E. ’37; “I don’t think the extra honor is worth the extra amount of worl^ that has to be put in to get it.^’ ■ / J. E. Burroughs, E. E. ’37; “I was quite surprised, but very happy. I thought I received a good break.’’ . vL. J. Doud, Ag. ’37: “It required perseverance, but satisfaction makes it worthwhile.” Virginia Gobble, Sci. ’36: “I think that regularity of class attendance had a great deal to do with my average. One can usually get the necessary material much more easily and quickly from classroom lectures and discussions than from outside study, especially if the instructor has had wide experience and has a keen interest in and a broad knowledge of the subject.” E. G, Greber, E. E. ’37: “I think it was mostly luck.” K. B; McEachron, E. E. ’37: ‘T don’t think that grades truly reflect a student’s worth.” D. B. Olen, M. E. ’36: “A great deal of my work was preparatory. I was doing research most of the time. I took only two courses, a fifteen hour course arid a five hour
course.’’
R. C. Robbins, Sci. ’36: “I have reached a goal. Now I can enjoy college life.” Mildred Leah Pitch, Sci. ’37, could not be reached by telephone. Of the eight persons interviewed, only one has made a 6.6 average previously. McEachron also won his way into the University hall of fame last seriiester. All of them have been distinguished before this senaester with the exception of Olen, who attained the perfect average along->with his first distin-gmshrid-Wting. ^lie^ffi^tinguished record of the eight to date is : Burrell, five out of five possible times; Burroughs, five out of five; Doud, five out of five; Miss Gobble, seven out of seven; Greber, three out of five; McEachron, five out of five; Olen, one out of seven; Robbins, six out of sevmi.

Acknowledging Job Well Done Those persons who contributed in any way to the success of the Student Union show, “Carmita”, deserve some sort of public recognition for a job that was well performed and for presenting to a Purdue audience the best performance of its kind that has been seen here for many years. The production showed the results of a great amount of effort and preparation, and it lacked the slip-shod, amateurish air that usually characterizes student-produced shows. Three years ago, the first Student Union effort was presented in the Union foalltoom, and was entitled “Cactus Capers”, It lyas produced on a comparatively small scale, but it is mentioned because it was the initial presentation of what promises to bring back to Purdue the theatrical glory that Harlequin club once held. Last year, “The Bright Young Thing” assumed more elaborate proportions, and this year the play exceeded all expectations. With only three milestones having passed, the present status of the show should produce student support and enthusiasm that will carry it to even greater heights. While orchids are being passed out, it seems fitting that a few members of the faculty should be included, for without their aid in the capacity of directors and others cooperating by seeing that scholastic difiEiculties did not ensue, the production would have been impossible, It is regrettable that such a great amount of work should be terminated in one main performance.. Possibly in the years to follow, student support will demand that the production continue for more than one night.

KNOW YOUR GOVERNMENT
The Constitution And The Supreme Court By C. Wo Mamm, From the time that Chief Justice John Marshall, declared by many to be the greatest of all the chief justices of the United States, assumed the right to declare acts of Congress unconstitutional, in his great case Marbury vs. Madison, the supreme court has been accorded the power to review acts of Congress. This power new exercised by the supreme court was not explicitly conferred by the constitution, but was assumed by Marshall’s decision. Many have declared that the decision in Marbury vs. Madison was a usurpation of power. There has been probably more criticism of the supreme court in the present administration, in which the N, R. A., A. A. A. and other New Deal measures have been declared unconstitutional, than in any other period of history of the same length. The chief arguments of those who are in favor of modifying or taking away entirely the supreme court’s power to declare acts of Congress Unconstitutional are as follows: 1. The framers of the constitution never intended the supreme court to review the constitutionality of laws passed by Congress and approved by the president. If they had so intended they would have made specific provision in the con-
stitution.
2. As representative of the people. Congress is the instrument of the will of the people, and its acts should not be challenged by judges who are merely appointees of the president. 8. The only reason the supreme court now has the power to declare acts of Congress unconstitutional is that Chief Justice Marshall assumed the authority and no real effort has been made to check that usurpation. 4. All the veto power needed over acts of Congress is that of the president who may nullify congressional action subject to reenactment over his veto. The principal arguments of those who are against interference with the powers of the supreme court are: 1. One of the principal reasons for calling the constitutional convention Was to curb the actions of the continental congress and of the various state legislatures. The submission of the constitution to conventions of the people for ratification, instead of to the state legislatures, was proof of this intent, 2. In setting up checks and balances among the legislative, executive an,d judicial branches of the government, the convention provided a supreme court to check both the Congress and the president in case the demands of occasional majorities should override the rights of the minorities, as guaranteed by the constitution. 3. Marshall did not usurp powers, he only set them forth in language so clear that his opinion has never been successfully controverted. State courts and federal courts had passed on the constitutionality of acts before Marbury vs. Madison without being criticized. 4. History has proved that the rights of citizens, states and minorities are much safer in the hands of the judges of the supreme court than they are in the hands of the temporary majorities in Congress. * By past arid present decisions the supreme court has proved that it is distinctly non-partisan. Would it not be better for the supreme court—a body not influenced by the changing opinions of the people, a body which has proved its integrity and impartiality-—^to make decisions on the constitutionality of acts of Congress, rather than Congress, which is often swayed by present events to enact laws that might menace the freedom of posterity? Do we want a government that legislates merely for the security of the present generation or one that will legislate for the future generations as well?

Noted KicfciMg Specialist To Appear Here On Football Program Leroy N. Mills, of Westchester county, New York, recognized as the country’s greatest kicking specialist, will present a demonstration and address on “The Kicking GWc’’ as one of the added features of the fifth annual Football Clinic which will be held herd on Friday and Saturday, April 3-4, it was announced yesterday by Noble- Kizer, director of athletics and head foot-
ball coach.
Mills, a leading lawyer in Westchester county, has spent most of his time studying the science of kicking a football and teaching this science to boys who have wanted to become leading football players. Although he has never sought publicity, his fame has spread far and ■nude due to the amazing ability of the players he has taught, including such outstanding stars as Frank Carideo, All-American quarterback at Notre Dame. Many colleges and schools have sought Mills’ services as a kicking coach, hut he has steadfastly refused to become a professional, although he consented to make a special trip here to give a special demonstration before the clinic. Outstanding college and high school coaches -will appear on the two-day program of the cliniCi the pioneer gathering of its kind in the country, and judging from the advance interest shown in the neighborhood of 600 coaches from Indiana and neighboring states -will
attend.
The program of addresses -will be supplemented by practical field demonstrations, using members of the Purdue gridiron squRd, which will be in the midst of spring drill, as models. A regulation game between two picked elevens -will pro■vide the closing feature of the
clinic.

A LIGHT SMOKE
OF RICH, RIPE-BODIED TOBACCO
For twenty“ive years the research staff of The American Tobacco Company has worked steadily to produce a measurably finer cigarette — namely, a dgarette having a minimum of voiatih components, with an improved rich’ ness of taste’-“A LIGHT SMOKE”
We believe that Lucky Strike Cigarettes embody a number of genuinely basic improvements, and that all these improvements combine to produce a superior cigarette—a modern cigarette, a cigarette made of rich, ripebodied tobaccos—A Light Smoke.
