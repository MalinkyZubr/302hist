Wilson went, not knowing what it was about and not knowing he was to sthy to ’ lunch. When he got there, he found himsfelf lunching with FDR, all alone. The conversation ranged over everything under the sun, from the problems of business management to Far Eastern trade to Latin American relatibns tri war BlanttCconYersirin. When the President asked for Wilsrin’s views on world'^trade, the former General Electric executive replied; "Mr. President, I’m a manufacturer, not a mer-
chandiser.”

The enthusiasm of a Purdue audience can,nptt‘ be denied. Whereas Hop Low, the ping mii^hroom with personality, (“Nutcrael^er Suite”) might be received with suppressed titters elsewhere, the whole hearted gufltaws he got here were enough to gladden any artist’s heart. Of course, one artless creature complaijtied about seeing spots before his eyes after viewing the Bach “Toccata and Fugue” Si^uence. To think that was the only impression con- . veyed to him by Disney’s colorful* brainchild. The Schubert “Ave Maria” was most powerfhi of all, though, because one sailor in the back row had his attention diverted from the girl on his right for a moment by the brilliant strains of “Fantasia’s” final sequence. On the whole, the audience enjoyed “Fantasia” with varying degrees of amazement, awe and genuine love of fine music. We wish f . that the. campus might have the privilege of seeing more reissues of old movies. ih 1941-42 the 'Union sponsored a series of yei^ interesting, old foreign movies that were
performances. The. Union bought the series !| , oi films through a New York copipany that ^ makes a business of gathering classic material ior groups such as college canipuses. The movii ies were not issued by the regular movie com- ' panics for a prdit.' The company gathered their films with the >1 / . ^ aid of the New York Museum of Modern Art, so they wiere really worth seeing—a relief I from the blood and thunder shown at the local * movie houses. series ran out at the end of the school year, and with that, student . . ‘ interest lagged and died out for lack of someI ,1 one to pu^ ihe project further. All this hapI ( pened befcH’e the time of most of the present undergraduates, hence they will not be able tp appreciate the fine cultural advantages that these movies afforded. We hope that in
