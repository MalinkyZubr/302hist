Split Over In^ia
Nobody will admit it publicly but, inside the Roosevelt Administration, somewhat the same split is taking place regarding India as occurred regarding the question of heading off with Japan before Pearl Harbor. Long before Pearl Harbor, a group of young men in the State Department.urged and implored Secretary Hull to cut off exports of oil.and scrap iron to Japan. They were supported by Secretaries Ickes, Morgenthau, Stimson and the late Secretary of the Navy Knox. Today there is a revolt among some of the same type of men regarding the fact that the Allied campaign in Burma has bogged down, due to the donqthing a|titiida of the British In India. They .feel that Ambassador Phillips .should have been supported in his forthright report on India to the President, and that the State Departnieht made a acrioaa.rnistake in bowing to the British by withdrawing him from London. Also they feel that India may be a breeder of wars in years to come if its problems are not
