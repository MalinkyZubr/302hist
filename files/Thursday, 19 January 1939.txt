Current Problems Of Indiana Highway Design, Construction To Be Theme Of Twenty-Fifth Annual Road School Show Current problems of Indiana highway design and construction will be the theme of the University annual Road School Show, to be held here January 23 to 27, announced Ben H. Petty, professor of Highway Engineering and chairriian of the Road School, yesterday. The School, which is celebrating its silver anniversary with this session, is brought to the campus through the cooperation of the University engineering extension department and the school of civil engineering.

Gov. Townsend...
of Indiana, will be the principal speaker at the anniversary banquet to be held January 26 at 6:30 p. m. ,Six hundred roadmen are expected to attend the banquet in the Memorial Union ballroom. J. L. Ungo, Director of the Public Safety Institute at Purdue, will speak on “The Human Equation in Highway Safety.” Other speakers will include H. E. Surman, engineer of design of the Illinois state highway department; W. J. Boatright, engineer of specifications of State Highway Commission; aqd A1 H. Wynkoop, city editor of the Lebanon Reporter. Expect 1,000 To Attend The School conducted with the assistance £)f the Indiana State Highway Commission, the Indiana County Surveyors’ and County Engineers’ Association, the Indiana County Road Supervisors’ Association, and several other state and county organizations, is expected to draw over 1,000 persons, representing every county in Indiana. “In Indiana this year there are 35 new county surveyors and 25 new county road supervisors. These men just entei’ing upon their duties of their offices, should receive considerable benefit from attendance at the Road School,” said Prof. B. H.
Petty.
' - County Road Heads “Under existing legislation the county commissioners have the option of either turning the county roads over to the duly elected county surveyor or of appointing a county road supervisor to handle county road affairs. This year in 21 counties the surveyors will be in charge of the roads and in 71 counties the commissioners have appointed road supervisors.” Doctor W. H. Hatt, former head of the University Civil Engineering School, founded the Road School in 1913 by calling a meeting on civil engineering. Following a similar conference the succeeding year, legislative action established the conclave as a school in 1915.
Awards for the best polished men in the University military corps were announced last night. Contests were held during corps days of January 12 and 17. Out of approximately 1,500 men assembled each day three men 'were picked. From the first brigade. Cadet Colonel R. R. Hannas commanding, R. E. Irvine, J. E. WilHts, and R. F. Abell were chosen first, second, and third respectively. D. V. Meeks, R. E. Lange, and R. E. Adams were chosen from the second brigade. Cadet Colonel J. M. Rudolph commanding. The winners were given $5, for first place, $3 for second, and $2 for third. The awards will be made at corps day the first part of next semester. Regents' Inquiry Staff Publishes Third Book “Adult Education” is the third of ten special volumes to be published by the Regents’ Inquiry staff, a group of famous educators. This study, a research on the education of men and women over school age in New York state, was organized under the general direction of Dr. E. C. Elliott, University President. Analysis of the data compiled by the staff reveals that this field of education is covered only in spots. Further examination shows that in general only particular groups are reached. Among the programs offered are ag education, naturalization of foreigners, home economics, and parent education.

G. L. Hockenyos, of Springfield, 111., will open the third day of the Annual Pest Control Operators’ meeting today in the Agricultural Building with a discussion on “Basic Formulae.” The meeting, which will continue through Friday, has brought to light many new facts regarding the control of termites and the elimination of insect hazards.

Third Student Book Exchange To Open Doors January 31 A non-profit organization for the good of the student body and one year old this semester, the semi-an-nual Student Book Exchange will begin operation Tuesday, January 31, in the ballroom of the Memorial Union Building, according to Sully Mason, chairman of the Book Exchange board of control. Operation of the Book Exchange is quite simple. The clerk takes the seller’s name, gives him a numbered stub, and when the book is sold, his number appears on, the bulletin board. Students who have texts and wish to realize cash on them, or who do not have the texts requiz’ed for the courses they plan to take, can make good use of the Exchange. Those in charge request that all students having books to sell bring them into the ballroom the first day, January 31. No books will be sold, however, until noon of the sec-
ond day.
Students Set Prices Students, may, of course, set their own prices on the books they turn in, but the clerks have been instructed to advise the student of a reasonable figure, taking wear and age of tKe volume into consideration. Only those books which will , be' used in second semester courses will be accepted by the Exchange. The hours of operation for this student book mai-t will be from 10 a. m. to 8 p. m. daily, except Sunday. The Exchange will continue from Tuesday, January 31, through Tuesday, Februai-y 7. Started A Year Ago Inaugurated at the University just one year ago, the student operated Book Exchange sold nearly 1,500 books and handled about $2,500 in the process. Handicapped at the beginning of this semester by lack of senior texts and inadequate advance publicity, the Exchange still managed to top their previous sales. Students in charge of third Book Exchange predict that even more students will take advantage of the facilities offered gratis. Responsibility for the third Exchange rests in the hands of E. S. Mason, H. I. Stanback, Thais Crepps, C. G. Elliott, and R. A. Buckles, who constitute the Board of Control. J. T. Donovan will be retained as cashier. Pubikation Schedule Exponent publication for the period of finals will be changed to every other day and suspended altogether for a short period between semesters. Papers will be printed Saturday, January 21; Tuesday, January 24; and Thursday, January 26. Daily publication will be resumed Monday, January 30.

Y. The band will be handled by Bill Martin, and A1 Kienly will act as baton wielder.

Recount Of Field Goals Gives Iowan Two Point Margin Over Illinois Center; Fisher Tops Purdue Looking at a list of leading scorers in the Big Ten basketball race this year presents the unusual picture of a man not from Purdue heading the parade. After Jewell Young’s scoring spree of the last three season’s, the idea of Ben Stephens, Iowa captain, leading the field with a mere 56 points in four games is
hard to realize.
The Iowan was considered to be tied with Pick Dehner, Illinois veteran center, after Monday night’s games at 54 points each, but a correction from the Hawkeye office gave Stephens an extra field goal. The basket was made in the Purdue game and was erroneously credited
to Dick Plett.
The closest Boilermaker is Dan Fisher, junior forward, who has garnered 25 points in the three Purdue encounters, while Bob Igney is in the battle with 23. Indiana Offense Good Indiana, tied for the league leadership with Illinois and Minnesota, leads all of the teams in collective scoring with 149 points or an average of slightly more than 37 per game. Ohio State’s 114 counters in three games for an average of 38 points per contest, tops the team average. Thus no squad has been able to maintain the coveted point-a-minute average.
