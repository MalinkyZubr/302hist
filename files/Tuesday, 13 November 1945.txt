just as It touched everything else; and the system used in the past few years of merely having a general students* section at the homp games has been a war-time measure. Accor^g to "Pop” Doan, who is the man behind the ticket scene, next year there will be reserved seats for all students fPr both hasl^thalf’And football, with seniors having first crack at the seats. Another principal argument has been “was thera orb was there not a senior section at the fbotball games?” Air. Doan reports that the seniors were allowed that privilege, but

This is no doubt where trouble arose, since an unorganized, unincorporated, and un-iihanced senior student body probably had difficultihs in carrying out sucn a scheme. Perhaps this situa^on could have been alleviated, but no matt^ now, since next year will remedy it. However, Mr. Doan has announced that a similar arrangement with regard to seniors’ seats-wj}l be followed for the coming basketball .season, May we suggest that the situa’tion during the basketball season be handled more effectively than it was for football— eithei’ that the seniors do organize and plan an "usher set-up,” or better still that the ushers be provided by the University since they

some ineUiod which would assure the senior students special seats, which, after nearly fouryeaYs of struggle, we believe they deserve. E^onent Sports Editor, Johnny Gratza, pointed out in his column Saturday that the lack of tiekete for students for the Ohio State and Indiana games was something which coiild hardly be helped by the University since the ^mes are played away*. Tickets for the Indiana game could perhaps have been saved until November students returned, but after tickets went begging,^ the chance was too great. With many more students, and a regular schedule next'year, that too will he unlikely to have a^repeat, performance. ^ Concerning the present sections of seats given to students—^the sections start at thfe
