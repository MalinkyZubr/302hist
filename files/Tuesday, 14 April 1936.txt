Comfort VS. Precedent At Prom With Junior Prom set definitely for May first, it has been suggested that, due to the lateness of the date with its accompanying warm weather, the usual formal attire ordinarily required at Prom be discarded in favor of the more comfortable "spring form^” clothing genera,lly worn at formal dances on the campus during the late spring and early summer months. Members of the Prom committee have signified their willingness to abide by prevalent campus sentiment in decreeing type of dress for the men at the dance, so the issue now lies entirely with the expressed opinions of the junior and senior classes... In favor of the proposal is, of course, as mentioned above, the weather. The prospect of existing for five hours in a "boiled shirt” and high collar w^th the temperature ranging in the eighties, as it is almost sure to be, is uninviting to say the least. TOy not instead, ar^e supporters of the plan, allow the men the heater freedom and comfort of seasonal clothing which is both distinctive in appearance and designed for the very conditions which will prevail at Prom time ? Prom has always been a strictly formal affair, and there are those who feel that any relaxation in dress requirements would detract materially from the color and dignity of the dance. But Would not the reverse be true? Innumerable "formals” during the past school year have robbed the tux or "tails” of their novelty while spring clothes would permit originality and distinctiveness in dress and would serve to open the “spring foraial” season on the campus. Semi-formal proms have been adopted as annual affairs at a number of other universities, particularly in the south. With comfort and appearance all in its favor and fe^ objectionable features against it, Purdue might well follow suit with its first "spring formal” Prom.—C. L. S.
Monetary Antithesis
The following quotations appeared in a newspaper account of the meeting of the Academy of Political Science held re eently in New York; “The world needs a gold standard suited to our time as the outstanding instrument of international solidarity. The world today is si managed currency world, and will continue until the forces of nature and larger minded statesmanship than any existing today will attempt to integrate the world instead of furthering its disintegration. The gold standard is the integrator. The only proper managed currency is one which has as the objective of its management the return to the gold standard.”—Adolph C. Miller, former member of the Federal Reserve Board. "The gold standard is a religion, an emotion rather than a judgment, a fetish, and international finance would be greatly facilitated if carried on in a paper currency of stable general purchasing power. The gold standard attempts to keep the exchange value of money at a constant weight of gold, and, unless there is an international government, it precludes the success of attempts to manage currency so as to keep a national economy running on an even keel and high level of productivity. The world will not tolerate a syste;^ which thus sacrifices greater to lesser ends. We will not retrace our steps.”—Frank D. Graham, professor of economics at Princeton University.
READERS’ OPINION The Exponent ieeicomet eonintenle of good taste and reasonable length from Its readers. Typewritten articles are preferred.
A .Foreword On Gala Week The 1911 class will celebrate its silver anniversary on the campus with a reunion which, from all indications, will be the largest class reunion ever seen oh the Purdue campus. There are approximately 400 names on the list of living class members and it is expected that at least half of that number will return to see their old friends, many of them the first time since they separated 25 years ago. The class interest has been maintained throughout the 25 years and the class news printed in the October AMmmis contained the names of all ^aduates and many of the former members who did not graduate. It was the 1911 class that started the custom of green caps for freshmen. It was the last class to participate in the old time tank scrap which ended at sunrise on the Saturday of the first football game. The class will return in the character of freshmen wearing their green caps and the members of the various schools will answer roll call at/their old buildings on Saturday, June from 9 a. m. to 10 a. m., and the'schools will theij unite promptly at 10 a. m. in front of the Union Building. During that day they will live over again the four years and receive their silver certificates from Pres. Elliott at 3 p. m. on the Oval... The 1911 class has returned a number of children as students at Purdue and one feature of the reunion will be an esMbit of the list of such children who have attended or who are now at Purdue. In order to make the list complete it is requested that all students whose father or mpther was a member of the 1911 class report their names and parent’s name to Mrs. Goldie Hoffer, 1127 N. Grant St., West LafayettSf who is compiling the list Ray Wakeland, 1911 Class Secretary.

It’s leap year and he meete all the requirements. ■ FAMOUS LAST LINES Why doesn’t R. B. Stewart abide by the campus automobile regulations—or does he?
An ed, a junior in the science schodl, sat smoking, a coke in front of him, and requested the. sphg again and- again as it stopped. He had had a fifty cent piece changed to nickels, planning to hear the Paul Whiteman recording ten tim^. “It scares me! I always feel sad after hearing it,” exclaimed a ffeshman home ec co-ed. She went on to say that if she Were feeling despair and heard the song several times she might be tempted to think of suicide.
A usually practical co-eds sings the song as she walks through the Campus. Her explanation of her fondness for the melody is that she finds it pleasing, and that it intrigues her, because she knows its reputation as the suicide song. “I suppose I feel daring When I sing it,” she said.
Facility To Hear Report On Lab Instruction Members of the teaching, research, and extension staffs of the engineering schools of the University will meet at 7:30 o’clock tonight in the faculty lounge of the Memorial Union Building to hear reports of the committees in laboratory instruction, comprehensive examinations, and English for beginners. Organization of staff groups to attend the meeting of the Society for Promotion of Engineering Education in Chicago Saturday will be taken up, according to the word from Dean A. A. Potter, who will preside.
Glider Club Buys New Tramlmg Equipment The Purdue Glider club added two new gliders to the club’s equipment Sunday afternoon when the members traveled to Culver Academy, to purchase two beautiful Detroit Gulls. They plan to use both primarily for training members to fly. ■ Yesterday afternoon the club experienced its first “thermo soaring” when W. B. O’Neal, junior mechanical engineering student, glided for three minutes and five seconds over the woods southwest of the airport.

Nickel after nickel is dropped— almost always for the same record ■the popular suicide song. One waitress exclaimed, “It gives me the jitters! I wish they’d stop it!^’ with forceful sincerity. Another girl said, “I’m-just tired of hearing it; eonietimeS I thiiik I’ll go criiki7 if I hear iifc e^iolher tim^^^
Three years ago, Reszo Seress, Hungarian composer, Wrote the l3^ic. Until recently, the verses existed in comparative obscurity. Budapest police, investigating a suicide wave, found excerpts from “Gloomy Sunday” copied on scraps of paper in the room of a suicide by poison. The investigators then discovered that seventeen other impressionable Magyars had taken their own lives after definite contact with the morbid tune.
While in a tavern, two men shot themselves, listening to a g3q)sy band give its version. Seven persons formed a suicide pact after listening to recordings several times. Five leaped into the Danube River, clutching scripts of the music, Many others killed themselves, leaving evidence that the strangely gripping composition was concerned in their decision to die. “Gloomy Sundasr” was banned in Hungary.
American music companies competed wildly to get rights to the piece. Brunswick, with Hal Kemp, made the first recording. Victor and Decca followed soon after, with Paul Whiteman’s and Henry Kng’s orchestras, respectively. And in college circles everjrwhere, f‘Gloomy Sunday” recordings are played and ninMin—Tiiiiiiiiiiir'ir i ii i nii m iiiii

Recover Mid^oscDpe Stolen Last Summer The mystery of the disappearance of the valuable Leitz ultra-, opaque microscope from the Biology building last summer has been solved, according to a report, by R. B. Stewart, edntroUer of l&e University. The serial number of'the microscope was found at a Philadelphia pawn shop, which was identified following the coi^ession of a burglar in New York City recently. The University has been on the look out for the stolen ’scope for some time. Upon its disappearance last summer, $100 reward was issued for its return as well as sending a notice of its disappearance to all parts of the state. The ’scope was pawned under a fake name at a price of $86 along with several other less valuable microscopes.

How does such a song affect peor pie to the great extent of suicide ? Dr. Ik^mble and Dr. Steer, of the education and Hnglish departments, respectively, say that perhaps the song is so morbidly suggestive of death that it induces to persons of hypersuggistibility thoughte of self destruction. The mood induced by the IsrriCs might be extreme melancholia, which would act to dissociate hearers from norinal reality. Next, probably, the susceptible hearers would be led to an obsession about death, The haunting rhsrthm, a strong appeal to the emotions, would stimulate the hearers to final action—suicide. Whether it is the mood induced, hypnotic suggestion, or the power of publicity, “Gloomy Sunda3i” is an unusual, oddly engrossing song. D..J.-;

A large crowd turned out for the double-header, but most of them had left before Purdue made their rally in the sixth inning of the second game. The first game was more of a practice game for the Bulldogs than ansrthing else, with pitcher Blackeby holding the Boilermakers to five scattered hits. Lefty Martin and Bob Rosser were unable to control the ball enough to keep the visitors from hitting. Glen Downey started on the mound for the home team, in the second game, but was taken out when, the first six men to face him accounted for a walk, four safeties and a fielder’s choice in the first inning. Bartz then went to the mound with what looked like a defeat for Purdue until the last of the sixth, the score being 9 to 8 in favor of the Bulldogs. Gardner’s Single In the last half of the sixth Malaska was first man up, and he grounded out; then Lucas and Young reached first on walks* Mangas singled to fill the bases, and Gardner followed suit when Piggy Lanibert sent him in to pinch hit for Mitchell. Lucas and Young scored on Gardner’s single. Krause then hit a long fiy to left field which Broderick misjudged; Krause went to second on the error, Gardner to third and Mangas
scored.
Sines Singles Johimy Sines knocked out a single and then took second on the throwi_ in, while Gardner scored. Armon was safe on a fielder’s choice holding Krause on third. Catcher Costas attempted to get Armon off first and Krause scored, advancing Sines to third. Downey grounded out to the pitcher as Sines scored. Malaska took a walk and then was caught off when he took a long lead. Meanwhile Armon came in from third with the win ning run. In the first of the seventh Butler attempted to take the lead again with the bases loaded and two out. Jewel Young, however pulled down a ’long fly to left field to cinch the game for the home
team.
Staller, short stop for the Bulldogs, provided the only excitement in the first game when he knocked out a home run. The Boilermaker rally in the sixth inning was the main feature of the second game, but most of the' Purdue students missed it. FIRST GAME Btm.ER ~ AB. R. H. O. A. E.
