Boilermaker Nine Wins Over St Joseph^ 8-0/ Emmett, Leifheit Pitch
I “ Damon Elder, Entire Party Sweep PIA Elections; Record Number Of Votes Cast
By Phil-Johnson Sporadic April showers failed to dampen ^he recently acquired batting power of the Boilermakers yesterday afternoon as they blasted out a ten hit barrage against an ineffective St. Joseph College nine for their sixth win of the season by shutting out the Pumas Tjidth an 8 to 0 score. Four Riveter extra base blows aided by five untimely errors on the part of the opposition were the main factors accounting for the Boilermaker Victory. Veteran right hander Johnny Emmert, starting his first encounter in over two weeks, got off to a shaky beginning by loading the bases with the first three men to face him, but finished the initial inning without being scored on and held the Pumas easily in check for the remaining four innings which he hurled. The chubby senior moundsman allowed opiy three hits during the five innings to chalk up his third victory of the season. Doherty Still Potent Sophomore Walt Leifheit replaced Emmert during the final four stanzas, continuing to pitch shut out ball and giving up only a pair of hits during his turn on the slab. Second baseman Harry McFerren led the winners’ attack with three hits during four trips to the plate, one of which was a slashing double to deep center. Dutch Doherty, who collected five for five in Saturday’s 16 hit onslaught of Macomb College, continued his batting spree by hitting safely his first two times at bat. The cheerful outfielder, after hitting a short single and a distant triple came within a foot of having a perfect day for two games in a row as he hit a sharp liner a foot foul over third .base before being called out on strikes. Pitchers Can Hit! Johnny Emmert and John Janisch, both members of the pitching staff, were the other Bcqlermakers hitting for extra bases, hitting for (Continued on page 2) Sanitary Engineers To Talk On Pool Care At Swim Conference OperatiDn and maintenanra of swimming pools will be considered at a conference to be held in the Fieldhouse tomorrow in cooperation with the Bureau of Sanitary Engineering of the Indiana State Board of Health.

^ By Martha Jane Fox Last opening night of Playshop’s thirteenth season will get under way when the doors open at 7 o’clock this evening for Ian Hay’s ‘‘Bachelor Born.” Romance combined with school problems makes the perfect play for any campus and this comedy is no exception. School masters and old flames come together to straighten up some snarls while boys, as usual, manage to keep their business tangled. Large Cast A large cast capably handles the rapid pace, under the skillful direc^ tion of William L. Deam. Samuel Marks did more than his share when he directed the construction of a beadtlful set. Portraying the Headmaster’s study, the room suggests ivy-clfid walls and hide-bound traditions accompanying the established schoql. Besides the regular performances, which will last through Saturday night, a special presentation will be given for Mothers’ Day on May 10. Student coupons may be exchanged for this performance. The curtain will go up at 7:30 o’clock tonight and tomorrow night, at 8 o’clock Friday and Saturday nights. No one will be, admitted while there is action on the stage. Ross Will Preside During Dedication Of New Structure Slowly realizing a dream come true, the new physics building will be one step closer to completion, when this afternoon at 1 o’clock the corner stone laying exercises will be held. All students are urged to be present at the corner of Northwestern and the Mall. David E. Ross, chairman of the board of trustees will have the honor of laying the stone. Other members of the board who are in session on th^ campus will witness the ceremony. The hermetically sealed copper box, which will be laid in the corner stone, will contain University events for our posterity. Documents and records of work by the physics department, actions of the board of trustees. University catalogs and bulletins as well as the Bible will be sealed into the box. Emo\t Will Speak President Elliott will accept the building in the name of the Univer“sity students during the "short speech-making ceremony. Dr. LarkHorovitz, head of the physics department will also say a few words in behalf of the faculty. “To 'those who have never witnessed the laying of a corner stone,” remarked Prof. D. K!^ Stedman, department consultant on the new building, “this ceremony w|ll be a highlight in their campus life.” e.w.n. Hort Society . .. will hold an open meeting tonight at 7:80 p. m. in room 117 of the Horticulture building. Prof. B. R.

Boilermaker Nine Lstter To The Editor: Drops St Joseph Speak Now--Or:
(Continued from page 1) three bases in the fourth and sixth innings respectively. Emmert got into trouble in the first by walking the first and third men to face him and allowing the second batter a single. He struck out the Puma clean-up man on three pitches, and made Gladen hit a sharp grounder to deep second which was ably fielded by McFerren and ended in a double killing to end the threat. Waste No Time The Riveters began scoring in the last half of the first frame on a lead-off double by McFerren and singles by Doherty and Janisch. They scored twice in the third on Doherty’s triple, a walk, and an error. A hit batter along with Emmert’s triple and MePerren’s second hit of the game accounted for two more in the fourth. Hits by McFerren, Janisch, and McCaffrey along with an error resulted in three more runs for the victors in the seventh before the Puma starting pitcher was sent to the showers and relieved by Leugars, who allowed no more hits during the final innings. New Line-up in Seventh Coach Pehring put in an entirely new lineup in the seventh inning, with Shorty Potenza sparking the Riveter shock troopers. The second nine played errorless ball in the field, but were unable to solve the second St. Joe hurler for any hits. The final inning was played in the waning moments of twilight, with visibility so poor that the pitchers had tiouble seeing the catchers’ signals. Time was called on several occasions when lights of cars driving noith on Northwestern street blinded the batter, catcher, and umpire who faced them.
Many people say “Sure, war is bad; we don’t have any business getting into this one but we will anyway.” The Gallup poll shows that at least 83^per cent of the American people don’t want to send any army abroad, no matter what happens “over there.” To send convoys means war. The administration admits it. Yet preparations for convoys proceed in direct violation of the wishes of the great majority of the American people. Eugene Grace, president of Bethlehem Steel Co., states that their shipyards are busy “converting passenger liners into troop ships for the United States Government.” There is only one answer the American people can give to those few who would drag us into the conflict: “Get out and stay out of the war.” Time is growing short. To prevent the entry of America into a war which will bring only misery to the many and riches to a select few, the American people, all of us, must speak out against the war. We know we are the majority. We Purdue students, as part of the American youth who will be called on to do the actual fighting and dying, must speak out for peace. Students demonstrate all over the country every April against the futility of war. This week, the 8tli of these traditional peace demonstrations will be held on the Purdue campus. Last year a million students all over the nation spoke out against involvement in this war. This year there must be even more voices raised. If we are to make it clear that the students of America are with the big majority of the people in wanting peace, it becomes important that these nation-wide demonstrations of students show the strength of their will for peace. Unless we speak now, clearly and decisively, against being dragged into war we may awake to‘find our protests gagged by war censorship. While there is still time you can speak out for peace at the eighth annual peace demonstration today, Wednesday, April 16, at 4 p. m., in Stanley Coulter Hall, room 211-213,' and hear Rev! Owen A. Knox of Detroit, Michigan, discuss the all-important question, “Is Peace Possible ?” —Donald L. Grant.

Bulldogs Oppose Riveter Trackmen Here Saturday Bull-dOg-Boilermaker rivalry on the cinders will be renewed this Saturday when Coach Ray Sears’ Butler track stars invade the Lafayette camp, facing Coach “Herman B. Phillips’ thinliea^in Ross-Ade stadium at 12:30 p. m. Boasting probably one of the best Indiana Conference hurdlers in Ray Alsbury, the Indianapolis squad will be striving to knock big Dave Rankin, outstanding Big Ten hurdler of the Riveters, from his seat of honor. Alsbury, only a sophomore, was the niost outstanding frosh runner for the Bulldogs last
year.
Another prominent invader will be captain Jimmy Stewart, Butler half - miler. However, Stewart’s times this year have been consistently three to four seconds slower than those of Alex Jentsch, who turned in a l.;59 half in the Michigan State meet at East Lansing last Saturday. Plans for Boilermaker track activity have been slightly changed in the past week, the original track card showing* the locals entered in the Kansas Relays. This schedule was altered, scheduling a triangular meet with Wayne University and i$uiler; however, Wayne of Detroit will not be present this Satur-
day.
A complete list of entries has not been posted as yet, but Coach Phillips, who was the Bulldog track mentor before coming to Lafayette, will be out to show Butler, which is also his alma mater, just what kind of material his team is composed of. His mainstays will probably be Rankijn in the hurdles, Weber in shot and discus, Anthony in dashes, Jentsch in the half mile, and Capt. Ed Holderman in the distances.
!
Main officials for the dual meet will be: Homer Allen, starter; C. M. James, finish judge; and E. G. Welch, timer. <i.e.b.

By Joseph Patrick Dolan On this page you will find the interesting batting averages of the current Purdue baseball team that has been compiled by Coach Pehring. Notice that little Spanky McFerren is leading the field with a total of 12 for 2^ (exc|uding yesterday afternoon’s game with St. Joe.) —I-I—-George Doherty started yesterday’s battle as if he were going to bat 1.000 for the remainder of the season. He singled to right the first time up The next time up, he drove long and high to left-field a colorful triple. His third time up, George slammed what appeared to be a home run into left, but it was foul by inches; he was then called out on strikes. -1-1— But George isn’t the only Purdue player that’s hitting the ball. Janisch, Leifheit, and Blanken are also pounding the pill. -1-1— At the start of the seventh inning yesterday, Fehring injected Carl Potenza into the Purdue lineup. Little Carl, peppery little second baseman, is by a whole length the most popular baseball player with the fans to ever play for Purdue. His loquacious antics have the crowd in stitches with laughter and rolling in the bleachers. —1-t— Carl is the kind of player that every considerate coach dreams of having around. He’s a kid who never quits until the last out is made whether he’s riding the bench or playing on the field. He loves the game and his kind keep spirits flying high! even during a slump. He may never be a ‘‘most valuable man,” but to the players on the squad and the fans who are dyed-in-the-wool diamond - goers, this little Italian mite is a real diamond in the rough of baseball, the kind of value that isn’t easily appraised —but felt deeply when lost. I-I To pick up the lost art of bowling, we hear that Dr. Miller’s famous Pill Rollers wish to settle business with the following organizations: Jim Miller’s Mis-Fits, Basketball squad, Exponent all-stars, Cary Hall’s Hest, Reamer Club, AH-cam-pus champs, and any dam sorority or resident hall that wants to spot him 500 pins or vice versa. Marysville, Mo.—^A sneeze by W. R. Tilson started a “six-months-no-run” large mantle clock to ticking and keeping perfect time. Tilson sneezed from ’cross the room.

Copfident Netsmen Mike Preparation For Tough Season This year’s tennis team is rapidly* rounding into shape. Captain Bob Anderson and two other returning lettermen, Ray Lucht and Fred Richards, look very promising. The team as a whole display determination and the boys are practicing earnestly. Three likely sophomores, Bill Van Camp, Dick Stettner and Gus Armstrong will probably complete Coach Laferee’s team. However, Bill Van Camp, a local boy, is at present ineligible. But he^ hopes to be able to play the team’s first match next week with Illinois State Teachers College. In the Fight Trying hard for a position on the team is Ken Baughman, sophomore, who just recently came out for the team. Since Ken missed the winter practice sessions which were held in the Fieldhouse, he is at a slight disadvantage to his competitors. There is a possibility that Coach LaBree may increase the squad to six men. In this case Ed Vaughan, southpaw, would stand a good chance of filling the vacancy. The schedule this year is the most ambitious the Riveter netsmen have ever had. It consists of 14 dual meets. The Intercollegiate State Meet, and the Big Ten Conference Meet. The game with Illinois State Teachers College is at present tentatively set for April 28th. During the tennis season, the boys on the team will be playing, on the average, almost four matches a week, p.g.m. Tennis Courts ^ . . . may be reserved for Saturdays and Sundays by calling in person at the IM check-out window of the fieldhouse gym.

Swimmers Get Awards Tonight; Fred Kratzer Is Elected Captain First major letters in swimming to be awarded under the new system that makes the aquatic sport a majbr athletic activity on the Boilermaker campus are to be announced tonight at a banquet in the Union. Under the new system the swimmers that come up to the exacting standards required will receive letter sweaters of the same type awarded to those athletes competing in sports always classified as majors. Three first places or the equiva- .
% f m
lent of 16 points in Big Ten meets or a place in the Big Ten or National Intercollegiate meets must have been won by each of the lads eligible for the major letters. Minor awards will be given to the boys that have showed ability in the pool but have not been able to collect the necessary tallies. Captain Kratzer Dick Kratzer, outstanding performer on the Riveter aquatic squad for the past two seasons and holder of the state AAU 100 yard free style event, was, last night, elected captain of next year’s swimming forces. One of the top ranking sprint men of the team, Kratzer hails from New York state, where, during his high sc|iool career, Ke
established a record untarnished by defeat. Adding color to the banquet tonight in honor of the Gold and Black swimmers, pictures of the ’ Florida trip taken daring Christmas vacation are to be shown. Although tonight’s activities more or less wind up the 1941 aquatic season, another important event is still on the calendar. Gala Galac4de Adding festivities to the Gala Week activities, the Dolphin Club IS, on May 3, presenting the Galacade which will feature the National Junior, Mid-States and Indiana AAU Indoor Swimming Championships.
