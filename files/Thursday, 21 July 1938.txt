PWA Grants Funds For Cary Halls ^ Completion of the Cary Hall quadrangle was made possible this week when presidential approval made available PWA funds to the extent of $446,363 to provide 45% of the $1,036,363 necessary for the construction of two additional sections. Preliminary plans for the new Halls have been drawn up, and Architect Walt Scholer will present detailed plans for the approval of the University Board of Trustees soon. Four Halls will be ready for occupancy next fall—the two new ones and the two original ones— with a capacity of 640 students. When the final two are finished the combined housing facilities of these and the Oliver Perkins Terry House, the Alpha Xi Delta House and the Wiley home will be over 1,000. The University Board of Trustees will meet tomorrow to approve this grant, the Women’s Residence Hall grant, and still a third grant made last Saturday for the construction of a chemical engineering building. Erection Of New Chem Engineering Building Assured Erection of a new chemical engineering building was assured last Saturday with the receipt of word from Washington, D. C., that the Public Works Administration has authorized a grant of $271,584 to be applied toward the construction of the long-needed structure. The total cost of the new building is expected to be slightly in excess of $600,000. The new home of the school of chemical engineering, which is now located in Heavilon Hall, will be be built in an L shape on the mall which opens on Northwestern Avenue. It will harmonize in design with the mechanical and electrical engineering buildings on the southeastern side of the mall, with one main entrance to be directly across the mall from the mechanical engineering building and the other across from the pharmacy building. Final action on the grant is expected to be taken by the University Board of Trustees at a special meeting this week, and it is anticipated that actual construction will get underway before the end of August. Clinic Ends With Finance Session Problems of school finance along with steps to be considered in the improvement of education of teachers provided the main topics last Friday as the University Educational Leaders’ Clinic came to a close. Enrollment for the week’s program, which was devoted to a consideration of the major educational problems facing the nation, exceeded all expectations, reaching a total of 211 educational leaders from seven states. Peterson Speaks Dr. Elmer T. Peterson, of the University of Iowa College of Education, nationally known for his work in the field of public school finance, was the speaker before the morning session. Discussion of his address on “School Finance” was led by J. W. Bosse, of the Indiana State Department of Public Instruction, who also acted as chairman. With J. G. Meyers, dean of education of Manchester College, acting as chairman, the afternoon was devoted to a discussion of “Next Steps in the Improvement of the Education of Teachers in the United States” by W. E. Peik, acting dean of the college of education of the University of Minnesota.

Gallup To Show How Opinion Is Measured
Christopher Columbus
Opinion Sampler
Forum quizzers next Monday will ask the question “Can Public Opinion be Measured” when they meet in the faculty lounge of the Memorial Union Building for their weekly discussion. They’ll ask that question to get the answer of the person probably best equipped to speak on that subject—Dr. George Gallup, black-browed, dynamic young director of the American
Institute of Public Opinion.
. .Ill- Dr. Gallup will outline some of
the methods he and his “opinion measurers” use when taking surveys and polls like the 500 it made in the last three years, He’ll tell of the laws of probable error and how he makes use of them in his work.
Predicts Accurately
He’ll show how he can predict the results of the closest election within five per cent accuracy 997 times out of a thousand by taking a sample of only 'SOO opinions. These 900 votes will serve no matter how many persons they represent. The catch to this is that the sample taken must be accurately representative. To insure this Dr. Gallup and his associates use six factors in determining their cross sections. These he’ll explain Monday. Other important sources of error which he will explain are wording of the question and timing
of the poll.
Wins World Fame The first man to apply the sampling technique in revealing public attitudes toward questions of wide interest. Dr. Gallup has won recognition throughout the world for his research and results in this field. His Institute of Public Opinion survey results are regularly published in 64 American newspapers, and his results in nation and state elections have been famous for their
accuracy.
The forum program will begin at 2:30 Monday afternoon, and both students and faculty members are invited to attend.
Dr. George Gallup, above, who is director p£,tbe American Institute of Public Ophyon, will be the forum speaker Monday when he visits the campus to answer the question “Can Public Opinion be Measured?”
Pifer Assists In Pig Club WorkDuring July and August, Ray W. Pifer of the agricultural teaching staff at Purdue, is assisting F. M. Shanklin in the supervision of pig club work in Indiana. Pifer, at one time a pig club boy, was student of a class con- ^ ducted by Carl Songer, Purdue graduate, who taught some years
in Ohio.
Pyblication Dates Summer Session issues of the Exponent will be published on the following dates: July 28, and August 4 and 11.

Rev. Monahan To Address Religious Convo Sunday
Reverend D. Lawrence Monahan, of Port Wayne, Indiana, will address Summer Session students. University faculty members, and the general public Sunday at the last regular religious convocation of the season to be held in Eliza Fowler Hall. Contrary to previous announcements the program is scheduled for 10:30 a. m. instead of 4:30 p. m. This change has been made in order that the time be better suited to the audience. In addition to Reverend Monahan’s talk the program will include entertainment by the Summer Session chorus who will sing “Adoramus Te” by Palestrina, and by special request will repeat the anthem it sang last Sunday, “Now the Day is Over” by Barnby.
Rev. D. L. Monahan
Tickets To Go On Sale in Union Today; Buyers Vote For King, Queen Fletcher Henderson and his famous radio, recording, and dance orchestra will come here direct from an engagement at Grand Terrace, in Chicago, to play for Purdue’s first Summer Prom on Briday night, July 29. This announcement was made yesterday
by Union Manager L. M. Vallely.
Fletcher Henderson, famed composer of “Christopher Columbus,” will bring his radio dance orchestra here July 29 for the first Summer Session Prom. Henderson will bring his band here direct from a radio engagement at the Grand Terrace, Chicago.
Rain Forces Sing Audience Into Eliza Fowler Hall By Helen L. Walters Delayed by last-minute preparations on account of rain, and to accomodate the Farm Bureau people who were attending a banquet at the Union, the second songfest of the Summer Session nevertheless got away to a flying start last night in Fowler Hall as A1 Stewart, master of ceremonies, remarked that out of 14 sings in the past few years, nine had been held indoors. The audience of about 1000 was put in the mood of the evening first by humming a song, then singing it softly and then as loudly as possible. This was followed by two numbers by the Summer Session chorus under the direction of Stewart, which set the stage for the evening. They were “Stars of the Summer Night,” with Don Bowden tenor, as soloist, and “In the Gloaming,” with Arsene Summers, contralto, doing the solo. America Has Best Chance - Jacobson “Whatever may be the ultimate fate of European civilization, America has a much greater chance to escape from the doom, if we but retain the glow of the high noon, if we remain steadfast to out ideals, no matter what may occuc: across the seas”, declared Rabbi David Jacobson, of Indianapplis, at the religious convocation last Sunday afternoon, v' “America is the child of enlightment”, said Rabbi Jacobson. “We have just celebrated the 150th anniversary of the Constitution, and our Constitution is a product of the ideals of the Golden Day. When Thomas Jefferson set to work to draft the Declaration of Independence, he had only to write down the ideas that were shared by all
thinking persons.
“Unless certain forces are arrested, we are once more in the age of the Caesars, an era marked by the formless strife for personal power, when common sense and reason become punishable offenses, when the books of knowledge are burned at the stake, when tolerance and humanity are to be scoffed at, when the individual is crushed and beaten by the world emperor who has
gained power.”
Recognized as the colored “king of swing,” Henderson has made a coast-to-coast reputation for his swing exponents over NBC networks and WMAQ from the Grand Terrace. He is the composer of his radio theme song, “Christopher Columbus,” and is almost as well-known as “Christopher Coloumbus” as he is under his own name. Tickets On Sale Today Prom tickets, available to all students, go on sale at 1 o’clock this afternoon in Exponent’s Union business office (room F) and at the main desk. Two dollars is the charge. Dancing to Henderson’s music will last from 9 o’clock till 1 on Prom night in the , Memorial Union ballroom. Formal dress is prescribed for the affair’, although requirements for men will not be strict . . . light coats and dark trousers, dark coat and light trousers, or light sports wear will fill the bill. Main features’ of the evening will be the grand march, at 10:30, led by the Prom Queen and King. The grand march committee yesterday narrowed the list of eligible queens and kings down to six names for each honor from the original roll of nominess. Candidates Prom Queen candidates still in the contest include Georgianna Baker, Ruth Bryant, Joyce Bumham, Georgann Schilling, Mary Jane West, and Kathleen Zollman. Summer Session male students up for the kingship are Jack Dobson, Robert Hensler, Howard Humphreys, Cecil Isbell, John Rumsey, and A. P, “Bud” Taylor. Each person buying a ticket may cast a vote for one of the queen nominess and another for a king candidate. Winners of the two titles will be notified before the dance, but first public announcement will be made during the dance. An unexpected total of 562 Prom permits were taken out last week by Summer Session students. While possession of a permit is not required for purchasing a ticket, each buyer must sign his name on a check list at*^ the sales desks.
Gov. Townsend Is Speaker At Farm Bureau s Banquet Indiana’s Governor M. Clifford Townsend last night addressed over 350 Farm Bureau representatives at a banquet in the ballroom of the Memorial Union discussing the Agricultural Adjustment Administration. “The United States government represents democracy in action,” said Governor Townsend. “The AAA is the highest form of democracy in action possible in our modem world. The government went to the farmers for this solution of their economic and social problems.” Over 600 persons attended this Farm Bureau Training School which began last Sunday and continues through today. The closing program today will include talks by H. R. Tobley, administrator of the AAA; Claude Wickard, director of the AAA north central division; and Senator Larry Brandon, vice-presi-dent of the Indiana Farm Bureau, Inc. Seed Testing Ends For 12 Saturday Twelve Summer Session students from 10 states will complete a three weeks’ course Saturday on “official methods of seed testing,” offered jointly by the University agronomy and agricultural chemistry departments. Given this summer for the fourth time, the seed testing course is chiefly of interest to representatives of the seed trade and those having official connections with it. Due to the nature of th:e work as well as limited laboratory facilities, enrollment in the course is limited to twelve persons. States represented this summer include Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee, Missouri, Kentucky, Illinois, Iowa, Michigan, Ohio, and Indiana.
Measure Culture By Development Of Athletics/ Advises Tunney
“I am convinced that the various cultures of the world can be measured by the development of the athletic and sports of the people,” stated ex-World’s Heavyweight Boxing Champoin Gene Tunney at the annual Summer Session banquet held in the Union ballroom for a crowd of 450 last Thui-sday night. Speaking on “Athletics and Their Influence on Civilization,” Tunney praised the Greek culture of Pericles’ time, and explained the part that the Olympic games played in this civilization. “No matter how modern civilizations become, it js hard to conceive of a pex’iod of clearer thinking, greater scientific achievements or greater development of the spirit of man, than that which existed
during the great Golden Age of Athens,” he insisted. Tunney minced no words in ciuticism of “tear down” educators. “Today the favorite spoi't of our educators seems not to build up the spirit of man through a higher and broader culture, but to tear down governments, as evidenced by the speeches and papers read before the National Education Association convention held in New York recently,” he said. Prof. Frank C. Hoekema, assistant to President Elliott, acted as master of ceremonies at the banquet. In addition to Tunney’s speech short talks were made by Pres. E. C. Elliott, David E, Ross, pji’esident of the University Board of Trustees, and Steve Hannigan, former Lafayette resident and Purdue student who is recognized as a leader in the publicity field.

A TALE OP WOE . . . concerning Bill Breuer who last week-end traveled to Chicago to swingeroo and susie-Q. Where does he end up but at the Grand Terrace Cafe in the heart of the colored district! Bruer stomps- in with a babe on each arm, and in a short time walks out after paying $9.50 (!) for only three glasses of refreshing liquid. But then comes the surprise— upon returning to school he learns that the Grand Terrace’s Fletcher Henderson will play for Prom; and tickets for only $2.00. ’Tis too much! Bill is quite excited over Henderson’s band, and already has four dates for Prom. Such enthusiasm! CONVERSATION IN LAFAYETTE BAR: 1st Student: “I’ll have a coca cola.” 2nd Student: “Make mine an orange ade.” 3rd Student: “Just bring me a glass of water. You see I’m driving.” Imagine giving up a week of vacation in Wisconsin to be in a summer school play! Yet, it’s happening. Ask Pat Heine. Is “The Monkey’s Paw” the real attraction, Pat—or do you have underlying motives ? ? ? TO BE OR ? ?

Perhaps slacks are the favored school attire now! Anyway, if The Champ can draw such a crowd of admirers to eat dinner with, more co-eds should adopt her mannerisms.

Chicago Cubs Drop Grimm/Name ^Gabby* Hartnett New Manager
League Standings
National League
Chicago, 111., July 20 (Special)—Charles “Gabby” Hartnett was named to manage the Chicago Cubs late this afternoon by P K. Wrigley, owner. Hartnett succeeds Charlie Grimm, Bruin
boss for the last six years.
“The announcement came to me as a real surprise,” Hartnett said tonight in a radio broadcast. Gabby said his ambition had always been to manage a Major League club.
" ~ “All the Cubs need is a little hypo,’’Jiartnett said when informed of his appointment this afternoon. “I think I can furnish the medicine.” Gabby indicated he would not make any radical changes immediately, but that changes would be made when they would help the team. Dizzy Dean will take his
regular turn on the mound. Hartnett started his Major
League career in 1922 with the Cubs, and he has been with them ever since. Gabby had the unusual experience of catching the first big league game he ever saw. Not counting this year’s games Hartnett has a lifetime batting average of .300 for 1,704 games. He has hit 208 home runs to place fourth in that department in the National
League.
Tuffs Lead Ross Softball League Todd’s Terrible Tuffs hold top position in the Ross Camp softball league by a safe margin with six straight triumphs.

ASCS Branch Picnics At Ross Camp Last Sunday By Anders Hustvedt Exponent Correspondent Ross Camp, July 21—Last Sunday’s picnic here attracted many distinguished University faculty as well as forty-nine members of the Indiana branch of the American Society of Civil Engineers, with their families. In spite of the rain the picnic was conceded to be a success. Four members of the University Board of Trustees, including David E. Ross, President Elliott, Dr. Kathryn McHale, and John W. Wheeler, Deans Potter and Knapp, of the schools of engineering, and Prof. R. B. Wiley, head of the civil engineering school, attended the picnic here. Work Progresses The “location” division has finished making its preliminary survey and is now ready to make the topograph of the line, The “topo” division has completed the measurement of the base line and angles of the triangulation system and is also ready to map its quadrilaterals. The dummy used at the picnic was put to bed several times last Sunday evening. When one student would come in and find the dummy in his bed, he would remove it and place it in the next cot where it would soon meet the same fate. The last “tucking in” came about six o’clock in the morning when the last one in went to bed for an hour’s sleep. The dummy was last seen at the top of the flag pole.
This guy Jerome Herman Dean is hard to figure. Four years ago b. s. (before sore arm) Dizzy used to sing a little song that started and ended something like this, “Me and Paul.” Paul was shipped down river to the Texas League, but that didn’t stop Dizzy’s vocal aspirations, no siree. —fc— The latest number from the pen of the great Dizzy is called, “Me and Angie.” Every day Dean and Galan play the infield during the Cubs batting practice. Dizzy says if Herman and Hack get hurt “me and Augie” will be ready to take over the infield. —fc— Diminutive Barbara Cook, Miss Purdue of the diving boards, is in Santa Barbara, Cal., to compete in the national AAU women’s outdoor aquatic championship. Miss Cook placed second in the national indoor diving competition last year. The meet will statr tomorrow and extend through Sunday. —fc— The football season is still around that corner but Bo McMillan, Indiana’s fine coach, is already singing the blues. Joe Szabo, veteran Hoosier guard, broke his elbow last week during a wrestling match at Fort Knox, Ky. Szabo was taken from the ROTC summer hospital to the Walter Reed Hospital, Washington, D. C. —-fc— The poll for the All-Star football game will close Sunday at midnight. Isbell, Schreyer, Woltman, and Zachary are still in the running. If you haven’t voted, send your ballots to Arch Ward of the Chicago Tribune. Coach LaBrce To Give Free Tennis Lessons Tennis coach Larry LaBree is starting a period of free instruction for those who wish to learn or better their game. He will meet those who want instruction at 4 o'clock tomorrow afternoon in room 105 in the Fieldhouse.

First Inning Splurge Fails To Earn Ross Camp Victory An early splurge by the Ros.s Camp baseball team was not enough to give them a victory over their Summer Sessiob rivals in a game at intramural field yesterday afternoon, as the Summer Session men came out with their third straight win, 10-9.
Softball Goes Into Final Round Softball goes into the final round this afternoon. Chief Clevett announced that all the results must be turned in before 4 o’clock this afternoon, and that all teams which feel that they have a chance to get into the playoff must come this afternoon to the intramural field to be paired off for the last round.

Third Games On Green On Tonight An assortment of games will test the varied talents of local “athletes” tonight on Varsity field north of the Fielhouse in the third evening of “Games on the Green”. Two courts of badminton will be placed on the east side of the field, “Chief” Clevett said last night. Ring tennis will be situ-
Wet weather was a great handicap to the pitchers of both teams, finally drawing the tilt to a premature close after the Campers had taken their turn at the plate in the fifth inning. Triples by Pogue, for the winners, and Crouch, for the losers, were the only extra base hits of the game. First Inning Lead Five runs in the first inning put the Campers in the leadj but after they added three more in the second, the home team woke up with four nins, sent in two more in the third, and finished it up with four more m the last of the fourth while their opponents were only able to add one score to their total. The losers collected 10 hits while the victors were only able to get four. “Timely” errors were responsible for the majority of the runs. Crouch led the hitting for the day with a triple and two singles in four times at bat, while Fant and Stuart each hit twice. Massoth pitched all the way for the Summer Session team, while Frey went the distance for Ross Camp. The victory gives the Sumer Session nine the series for this summer. However they will play the other two games scheduled, the first of which is next Wednesday.

How To Repair Your Own Carl
FIRST—Put on yo\ir dirtiest clothes so that you can crawl under your car.

THE PURDUE SUMMER EXPONENT
Thursday, July 21,1938
NEWS since Sunday
NATIONAL “It Was AU A Mistake” . . . . . . insists Doug Corrigan, but the world so far has just chuckled and given him highly publicized credit for the most “foolhardy yet daring” feat that ever made a hero and a very rich man out of a lucky Irishman who before was neither. Incorrigible Corrigan tells how he set out for Los Angeles Monday in his $900, nine-year-old monoplane, set the compass wi’ong, accidentally flew the ocean and landed '—^to his sworn surprise—in Dublin, Ireland. His tale includes denial of, ever seeing the ocean, and a statement that he flew for 28 hours over clouds, then ducked down to earth expecting to see Los Angeles. Money, vaudeville offers, free airplanes, and free boat rides have been thrust upon Corrigan, who still is in technical dutch with both American and Irish authorities for his unauthoi’ized ocean jaunt. Heroism’s Rewards . . . . . . due to 10-year-old Robert Moul-
ton, of Indianapolis, will not reach him in earthly form. He rescued two of his older friends Tuesday when they stepped into a creek bed hole while hunting “goldfish,” but Robert himself was caught by the current and sucked to drowning death. Stock Values .. . . . . rose more than one billion dollars Tuesday after the heaviest day of trading since October 21, 1937. Transactions totalled 2,920,000 shares on the New York exchange, while price advances ranged up to six dollars a share. Tickers were six minutes behind durihg part of the day. WASHINGTON A Seven-Pound Son . . . . . . born to Mr. and Mrs. Franklin D. Roosevelt, Jr., Tuesday night made the nation’s Chief Exectuive a grandfather for the eighth time. Young Franklin and his 'wife, the former Ethel du Pont, laughed off the idea of naming the President’s fourth grandson “Franklin third,” were in no hurry to choose a name. Aboard U. S. S. Houston . . . . . . en route for Socorro Island, 250 miles south of the extreme southern tip of Lower California, the President and his companions

enjoyed his favorite sport yesterday. Roosevelt will end his vacation at Pensacola, Fla., August 9, after a cruise down to the Galapagos Islands below the equator. STATE Indiana’s Lawmakers . . . . . . rolled up their sleeves for action Tuesday as they began the special session called by Governor Townsend, which administration leaders predict will run only eight days. Townsend addressing the legislators on the opening day stressed three major issues: 1. Appropriation of funds for institution building program. 2. Allocation of State funds to relieve counties of part of their walfare costs. 3. Revamping of the “gadget” law. Rapidly setting to work, the Assembly reported favorably on several Townsend suggestions but balked at “rubber-stamping” the $11,000,000 pump-priming building program without thorough and lengthier consideration. WAR Rebel Successes ... ... do not discourage us. That’s the word from Spanish Foreign Minister Julio Alivarez, as the civil war enters its third year. From the opposing camp comes the report that Gen. Francisco Franco believes his Rebels have virtually won the war. The insurgent chief is sorry that outside influence has caused the conflict to continue. Meanwhile from the front come reports that the Loyalists abandoned many of their Valencia front line defenses before a Rebel offensive. Mounting Tension . . . . . . between Japan and Russia became apparent this week when Japan ordered Russia to withdraw her troops from Nipponese controlled Manchukuo. Russion border forces invaded Manchukuo July 11. The Japs protest was taken directly to Maxim Litvinoff, Soviet foreign commissar. Aerial Raiders . . . . . . continue to bomb Hankow, provisional capital of China. Five hundred Chinese were believed burned to death Tuesday when a theater in which they were seeking shelter was bombed. Chinese officials in Shanghai claim the Japanese march up the Yangtze River Valley has been halted. FOREIGN Samuel Insull, . . . . . . former American utility magnate, died in Paris Sunday. Insull, “four billion dollar failure,” died with only 30 cents in his pocket, Edwin A. Platt, United States counsel, says. He’ll be buried in his native London. Dowager Queen Marie... ... of Roumania, mother of King Carol II, died Monday in Bucharest, ending a sensational career. In 1927 she visited America in a highly publicized trip to get a loan for her government. In her will the Queen requested that her heart be buried in a silver urn in the court of the loyal palace. She also asked that the ladies of the court wear purple mourning dresses rather than the conventional black. British Doctors . . . . . . won a notable victory this week when a London court acquitted Dr. William Aleck Bourne for performing an illegal operation. Dr. Bourne operated to prevent a 15-year-old girl, rape victim, from becoming a mother, thus violating Britain’s statute against such surgery.
Rain Storms Liven Knox Routine
By Milton Reeves Exponent Staff Correspondent Fort Knox, Ky., July 20—Who was it who told us in a junior military training class that it didn’t rain very often on the post here ? I believe it was Captain Holmes. Well, he certainly was corect; it doesn’t rain often, but when it rains, it really pours. A week ago Monday evening, the rain and dust, pushed by a raging wind, descended op this camp with such fury that for a moment I thought it would jerk every tent from its moorings. The suddenness of the storm took almost everyone by surprise; so we had to work like mad to save our tents. You see, when the canvas or
ropes get wet, they tighten up like a drum, and since these materials can stand only so much tension, you have to be careful or you’ll have your whole tent flat on the ground. By loosening the ropes, rolling down the sides and making them fast to the floor, and by lacing the flaps tight most of us were able to keep our tents up and some of the water off the floor. However, there were those few who did not fare so well. Mounts and Moran, motor sergeants for B’try “B”, were not able to hold their tent, much to their embarrassment. B’try “A” must have had a stiffer wind through their area because five of their tents were battered to the ground. Four of these were put up again as
soon as the storm subsided, but the fifth was damaged beyond further use. Consequently, the occupants, David Butler, Dave Clugston, Hugh Scott, and Union Prexy Matthews had to spend the night in their neighbors tents.
