Purdue 4~H Tops List In Recent survey made in 12 middle western s|;ates reveals that a greater percentage of the students enrolled in the University schools of agriculture and home economics are former 4-H Club members than in any other college of agriculture and home economics in the district. Pqrdue topped the list with 50.61 per cent of its agricultural and its home economics enrollment former club members. Illinois ranked second with 46.67 per cent, while Kansas ranked third with Nebraska and Kentucky following in the order as named. The survey also revealed that the number of 4-H club members en-
lllini Squad Superior Throughout Game; Both Teams Play Poor Ball CHAMPAIGN, ILL., FEB. 20—Completely off form on their shots, the Purdue basketball team went down to bitter defeat here tonight 35-26 at the hands of Doug Mills’ University of 11^ linois sharpshooters in one of the most listless conference basketball games ever witnessed. With both teams passing badly, missing shots, fouling regularly, and completely exasperated by the inefficient officialing, even the crowd couldn’t get warmed up to the feel of the contest and heaved one huge sigh of relief when the gun sounded ending the poorly played game. Unable to find the basket, Purdue was no match for the Illinois squad which presented a much better style of play than was exhibited in the previous encounter betweeli the two conference schools. Yeager played an excellent defensive game, holding Dehner practically scoreless during the first half. Little Bob Igney was the sole exception to the general scoring inability of the Riveter squad, garnering six baskets during the contest and playing his best floor game of the year. »■ in"

rolled in the various state colleges of agriculture and home economics has increased more than 800 per cent over the number enrolled in the same institutions in 1927-1928. “This data seems to indicate that the 4-H Club movement is fostering a desire on the part of members to obtain additional scholastic training,” R. A. ^Turner of U. S. Department of Agriculture, commented. Of the 839 students enrolled in the University school of agriculture, 451 are former 4-H Club members, while 346 of the 73t students enrolled in the school of home economics are former club members.
Super Pep Session Planned For Friday; Pres. Elliott To Speak In preparation for the Michigan and Indiana games, a super pep session will be held in the Pieldhouse Friday, at 7 p. m. In answer to ah invitation extended by Stubby Meier, President Elliott stated that he would be glad to attend the session which is sponsored by Gimlet, Reamers, Skull and Crescent, and Gold Peppers. In his own inteiesting and humoious manner, he will tell of some of his recent experiences m the Philippines. Otherspeakers will be Piggy Lambert, Athletic Advisor Nobe Kizer, and Captain Gene Anderson. The session will open with a number by the band, followed by a few cheers, led by the enthusiastic, tumbling cheer-leader. Stubby Meier. “If the students who turn out for this frolic make as much noise per capita as the gang that turned out for the Wisconsin pep session did, the Michigan team will be scared by the echoes. The program is assured to be a snappy, fast moving affair,” said Stub. The session will terminate in time for all the campus Lotharios and Casanovas to dash home and get ready for the Women’s Pan Dance. Bud Fenstermaker, senior cheer manager, when contacted about the vocal jam session commented, “Purdue fans will get a chance to get their cheering timed with the tumbling of the yell leaders. Although the more formal cheering has been abetter than in many years, several students have suggested that some of oifi- antics are too involved to follow the first time.” Scrivener To Publish Best Essays,StoriesOfContesl; Runner-ups In Next Issue Stories and essays, which received honorable mention in the annual Scrivener contest for freshmen students, will be printed in the April issue of the Scrivener magazine. These include contributions by Enid Thomas, Carolyn Britton, W. Walton, Neil B. Carson, and Leslie Phillips. Nearly 226 of the best themes received from English 32 students were turned in and from these, articles by the above students were chosen. The prize winning stories were published in the last issue.
First Half Summary Beretta fouled Hapac on the tjpoff but the Illinois foiward failed to score. Neither team showed much in the way of scoiing ability during the first three minutes of play and after the ball had changed hands several times, Drish batted one m for the first tally of the game. Hapac sunk a long one from the middle of the floor, and Igney matched to make the score 4-2 in favor of the mini. Purdue seemed unable to break into their customary offensive. Sachs scored a long shot from the field, and Hapac made good his two charity throws to make the score 8-2 in favor of Illinois after 7 minutes of play. Wardley added another point on Beretta’s foul. Igney scored on a fast breaking drive. Herschelman replaced Bei'etta after the stellar guard had collected his third foul. Drish scored and Igney matched with a long one from the side of the floor. Drish collected on a charity toss and Dehner scored from the corner to make (Continued on page 4) Convo To Present 'Mystery Girl' For Two Peformances Angna Enters, “Mystery Girl” acclaimed from coast to coast and in Europe for her unsurpassed ability, will appear before the students, and townspeople tomorrow night and Thursday evenings to present her Dance Mime. As in the past, the Convo will be held in the Memorial Gymnasium and will start at 8 p. m. both evenings. All senior, freshmen, and staff members’ green passports will be good on Wednesday evening, and all other passports and tickets will be good on Thursday evening. New Form Of Art Miss Enters performances have often been called a new form of art. Without support of scenery or dialogue, she presents short and vivid ! character-sketches. Also, she de- / signs all her own programs in such a manner as to keep her audiences spellbound for two hours without a word being spoken. The program that Miss Enters has prepared for her performance on Wednesday and Thursday evenings promises to be one of novelty. A new number in her repertoire called “Balletomane Connoisseur” is a satire of those Russian dancers who are to be found every summer vacationing in the neighborhood of Cote d’Azure. This number carries a subtitle considered the best witticism of the season by the New York presses, “Riviera stay away from my door.” Several Openings... . . . exist in the University Choir, according to a statement by A. P. Stewart. Tryouts will be held from 9 a. m. to 1 p. m. Thursday in A1 Stewart’s office in Fowler Hall. Any student with a 3.6 average is eligible to apply. The choir is now working on the “Crucification,” by Stainer, for the Easter religious convocation.

The ladder of Big Ten opposition which looked as if it would lead Purdue right up to customary spot in the first division suddenly turned out to be very unstable over the week-end . . . and so we stand with two more defeats on our record as the team, minus the tutelage of “Piggy” Lambert, dropped a very decisive battle to Illinois last night. —^fc— Statistics again point the way as the Illlni managed to make 21 per cent of their shots count whUe the Boilermakers only chalked up 13 per cent of their efforts . . . the Conference high point men Hapac and Dehner were too much for the desperate attempts led by Igney, who made five of his long shots add into the total. What looked like a rally in second half as Dickinson started a five point run while Illinois was scoreless was shortlived when the lUini again forged ahead by holding the Purdue men to one point while they made up their winning margin by getting 10 of the counters. —^fc— Illinois on its home floor was one of the two pitfalls in Purdue’s hard schedule last year and the Boilermakers made up for it when they played host to the lllini later in the season . . . this year the tables were turned as Purdue was decidedly outclassed and was unable to cope with the revenge goaded Illinois sharpshooters.

THE PURDUE EXPONENT
J-acduMA,
Tuesday, February 21,1939
li Looked— ... for a time as if Purdue were going to have an All-Campus musical show this year and in years to come. In fact a constitution had been written and plans for this year’s production had been drawn up. This constitution and plans had once been approved by the Student Senate, the Dramatics Committee and by A1 Stewart and Kenn Carmichael. Evidently these plans gave too much power to the students involved, however, since proceedings were begun yesterday afternoon to dissolve and set aside the work done in making the plans for an All-Campus show. A group of students and faculty members met in the Union yesterday to talk over plans for the coming show. This group finally adjourned after a hotly controversial two-hour session dluring which they had agreed to change the constitution of the All-Campus show in such a way as to make it a production completely and supremely controlled by the faculty. Article II, Section /... ... of the constitution previously read: Section 1. The production of the show shall be in the hands of a Board of Control composed of the following: (1) Three University staff members: (a) The director of music, or his appointee who shall be in charge of music. (b) ^ Two members appointed by the chairman of the speech staff, who shall be in charge of business, stage, cast, and dance. (2) Five student members appointed by the Electoral Board as follows: Dance Director, Stage Manager, Business Manager, Rehearsal Assistant for Cast, Rehearsal Assistant for Orchestra. Now, after this hectic session yesterday afternoon, the group plans to eliminate part (2), thus dealing all students out of the Board of Control. They expect to take care of the directorial and managerial positions by allowing these three faculty “dictators” to pick student assistants for these jobs. These students would not be on the Board of Control. Among the powers and privileges of the Board of Control are included: picking the show, arranging a time and place for production, making all plans for production, making all expenditures necessary, selection of book and music for the show, deciding the division of the profits (regulated by constitution) and amending the constitution. Yesterday’s group, which now has charge of the show’s future, arbitrarily agreed to take the matter out of the hands of students and give the faculty a monopoly on control. Faculty members of Playshop and the musical organizations (Kenn Carmichael and A1 Stewart) say they want this change because a board of control containing so many students and faculty members as the original constitution'provided would mean “too many bosses.” They believe that eight persons with authority is too many, and that confusion would result in the production of the show. In that case it would be far better to eliminate the faculty members and have an all-stu-dent Board of Control. Perhaps Mr. Carmichael and Mr. Stewart forget that this University is governed by a board of nine trustees. Surely these trustees do not cause trouble in the University administration by trying to act as “bosses.” The truth of the matter is that Mr. Carmichael and Mr. Stewart, seconded by Prof. Monroe (member of the dramatics committee) and other faculty members in this little group, are afraid to give the students any power because their professional reputations are at stake when they help produce a show.

The All-Campus Show... . . . should be a student activity, not a “faculty review.” We cannot blame these staff members for wishing to protect their reputation, but we can blame them for trying to rob the students of their right to put on their own show. Those professional reputations should not be built upon ability to put out good shows by virtue of absolute authority and an iron hand—^they should be built upon the ability to advise and help students produce good shows. Under Article II of the constitution there previously was another provision which met with disfavor yesterday: (6) The Board of Control may, if it sees fit, make provision for awards to deserving students in the cast and on the staffs, and may also provide for a party for those participating in the show. This provision was originally placed in the constitution to take care of situations similar to one which arose last year when those in charge of the show refused to let the cast blow itself to a party even after the net profits totalled more than $230. We won’t attempt to explain why this provision was object^ to ... we can’t understand it ourselves. The constitution in its original form was a compromise. Students gave in to faculty on several points in the beginning. Then all approved the plan and seemed enthusiastic about it. We can’t begin to figure out why the sudden change of opinion unless Carmichael and Stewart suddenly got cold feet. In behalf of the students we emphatically reiterate: Let us have an all-campus STUDENT show ... we don’t want a “faculty follies!”

Indiana Ekes Out Win Over Iowa, 45-40; Ohio State, Gophers Topple Big Ten Foes Indiana university’s Big Ten pacesetters, playing without Captain Emre Andres and Bob Dro, who have influenza, came from behind in the second half of a bitterly fought game here tonight to defeat Iowa 45 to 40 and retain the conference leader- ‘ ■ ship.
lowaFroshOutswim Boilermakers, 53-22 A powerful Iowa freshman squad defeated Coach Eastwood's team 53-22, in a telegraphic meet February 14, reports compiled yesterday revealed. Aside from an Iowa forfeit in the 50 yard free style sprint the Boilermaker yearlings were unable to score better than one second place. Kratzer lost the 100 yard free style by four-tenths of a second for the place. Anderson garnered two thirds as both McCredy and Frank scored one third place apiece. The 400 yard relay quartet was defeated by less than a second, the report revealed. Coach Eastwood states that the Iowa aggregation is one of the strongest in the Midwest and will be at the top as a contender for the Big Ten crown.
A New England College Rifle League has been formed for sharpshooting competition among institutions in those states.
The Iowa cagers were out in front 21 to 20 at halftime, but the “Fighting Hoosiers” came back with a rush to swing into the lead. A few minutes before the end, the Iowa quintet started a rally, but Indiana managed to cling to a slim victory margin. / Buckeyes 30, Wildcats 26 Ohio State rolled up its seventh victory of the season against Northwestern tonight, 30 to 26, and stayed in the midst of the fight for the Big Ten basketball championship. With high scoring Jimmy Hull slowed down by influenza, the Bucks had to come through at the free throw line. Both teams definitely were off on their field shooting, but Ohio State bagged all six of its free throw attempts and in turn committed only three personal fouls. Gophers 34, Badgers 32 Minnesota clung to its remaining chances at the Western conference basketball championship tonight by squeezing through with a 34-32 victory over Wisconsin’s stubborn Badgers. The score was tied six times. Big John Kundla, forward, sparked Minnesota with 15 points.

Minor Sports Squads See Intensive Action Ahead On Week's Schedule Several minor sports squads will see action during the coming week, with the wrestling, fencing, and boxing teams bearing the brunt of the attack on Boilermaker opponents. Cloach Claude Reeck’s grapplers will engage Illinois State Normal here on Friday night and then travel to Wheaton, 111., on Saturday night for a dual meet with Wheaton College. Injury hit the squad yesterday in the form of a torn cartilage for Willey, 166-pound grunter, but he will probably be back in shape for the match vsdth Illinois Normal. Coach Reeck also hopes to take both a freshman and varsity squad to the Indianapolis A. A. U. wrestling meet. The fencing team will meet one
of its oldest rivals Saturday when they go to South Bend to meet the Notre Dame Irish in a dual match. This match will be of special interest to followers of the sport for it will be the last appearance of Prof. De Landero, Notre Dame coach, before he leaves for Mexico to look after business interests there. Meierson Best Hope Meierson is the team’s best hope at present since his excellent showing against Chanuate Field in a recent match. The specter of ineligi-
bility loomed over the squad with Art Levin, one of the mainsta3rs of the team, on the sidelines, but he should be back in uniform by Saturday. The military boxing finals tonight and the Golden Gloves finals tomorrow night hold the limelight but next week an all-campus boxing carnival is scheduled to start. Anyone wanting to enter is warned by “Punchy” Maxwell to come out now and start getting into shape.
