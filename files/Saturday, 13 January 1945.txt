Word comes to us via the Monon that an upstate cow school (sometimeff called an agricultural institution), or, more' commonly known as P.U., has challenged us to a duel of '^Vits and paper,” mostly paper.

The award should stimulate their interest ^ in doing their teaching job better. -An alternative suggestion would be a general raise in instructors' salaries, but that , . would cost too much, more than the interest of the fund. In addition to a general raise, all instructors might be paid according to teaching ability, with bonuses fpr research projects. f0 mahe sweeping reforms such as these . would retire a lot of money. ■ "f Then'why shouldn’t the State of Indiana I refrain from putting large spms in bulky ^ ^ ehnnks of marble, and instead use the money to rehabilitate the educational system ?
