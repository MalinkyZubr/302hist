Diamondmen Beat Northwestern, 7-6, In Twelve Innings Janisch Scores Winning Run On Bunt By Fisher; Emmert Victorious Pitcher
By TED CLARK
Captain Bud Fisher's bunt scored John Janisch in the twelft^i inning yesterday afternoon on Ross-Ade Field to give the rejuvenated Boilermaker baseball team a 7-6 victory over Northwestern and sweep the two game series with the Wildcats. The final play was a nice execution of one of baseball’s prime examples of strategy—the “squeeze play.” Janisch was almost to the plate when Fisher thrust his body forward, “choked” hit bat and dumped the ball in front of the plate. John slid under Arnold, NU catcher, and 1,500 fans went home happily afterhaving
seen 12 packed innings of baseball.
At the outset of the contest it ap- ’
Mothers, Dads See Final Performance Of 'Bachelor Born'
peared that Northwestern was out to revenge themselves for Friday’s defeat, for they got to starting pitcher Janisch for two runs in the first inning. Erdlitz, who collected three hits during the afternoon, opened with a single to right, stole second and scored on a triple by Hennerich. The latter scored on an infield out by Arnold.
Don And George
Blanken and Doherty decided to get one of those runs back in the second. Don slashed a screaming triple down the left field foul line and came in on George’s tap to the
infield.
Stan Klores’ Cats tallied two runs in the fifth, but the Riveters ^ came back in their half of that irame with four big markers, which put them in the lead, 5-4. Bud Fisher opened the scoring burst with a single to center, went to second when McCaffrey walked, took third on McKinnon’s error and scored on McFerren’s single, which also brought in McCaffrey. Young added run number three on Janisch’s infield out and McFerren completed the scoring on Blanken’s infield hit. NU tied it up in the sixth on a double by Sampson, an infield out and a fly. Bud Fisher once more came to the fore wjth a lengthy home run in the home half of the sixth to put Fehring’s Crew in the lead again, 6-5. Once more the see-saw aspect of the game was brought into prominence. Northwestern recorded its final tally in the seventh when McKinnon opened with a single, advanced to second on a walk to Erdlitz, and scored on two infield outs. Both teams remained scoreless for five innings until the game winning play in the twelfth. Sparkling Fielding Perhaps the^ most outstanding paly afield was contributed by Bill (Continued on page 3)
By Lee Ruffner Bill Sharpies blustered, Harold Martin growled, William Lester ‘orated’ and Pauline Martin bounced their way through the special performance of ‘Bachelor Born’ given last night before a house filled with mothers and students. With this play, Purdue Playshop concludes the season, and a fitting conclusion it was. The entire cast turned in an admirable bit of work. Ann Ostrander, instead of merely decorating the scene, was convincing in her role of the least slaphappy of three sisters—^the Martin gal mentioned above and Pat Frigge completed the trio, and spent the entire time makinfg life interesting and unprofitable for the various bachelors around the set. Also liked was George Zissis who lent an air of bewilderment to the proceeding each time he appeared. ^ We still marvel at that set—Samuel Marks and his boys must have put in a lot of time on it. The play was directed by William Deam. Dr. C. K. Ganong ... of the Department of History, Economics and Government, will give the annual Memorial Day address at the University at 9:30 a. m., Friday, May 30, it was announced yesterday by Piesident E. C. Elliott. His subject will be “The Threat of False Ideals.” The exercises will be held”in Eliza Fowler Hall, in accordance with tradition, and will be for both students and faculty.
Giant Magnet Demonstrates Atom Smashing In Physics Lab
By Ernest Nordlinger Have you ever picked up a penny and tried to count the copper atoms that form its composition? You won’t be^able to, but the University owns a giant instrument, called the cyclotron, that actually smashes the nucleus from the copper atom. With the use of an electric circuit it IS able to count the atoms in a given area. With less than 20 cyclotrons or atom-smashers in existence, the University is extremely fortunate to own one of the largest in the world. At present it is found on the ground floor in the new wing of the Physics building, but in September it will be permanently Ideated in the new'ly constructed Physics building on the Mall. When inspecting the atom-kmash-ei we had to walk around steel tanks which contain water to stop the escaping particles. In the room stood a rectangular magnet, eight feet tall and several feet thick. In the center of the magnet is a hollow evacuated cylinder, where the actual splitting of the atom takes place. Two Operating Panels Across the hall we found Andy Guthrie, graduate assistant, sitting at the controls, willing to tell us something about the campus prize. Although there are two operating panels, one in the cyclotron room and the other pahel two rooms away, Guthrie prefers the latter since the instruments are just the
same and human life is not endangered. The simple experiment of the penny attracted much attention at the Open House program, but many did not fully realize its significance. A stream of deuterotts (nuclei of the element deuterium) is pulled out of the cyclotron chamber by a high voltage. When a copper penny is placed in this stream, some of the copper atoms lose their identity. These atoms show the properties of a radioactive metal similar to the true copper except for its radioactivity. The few million copper atoms that are affected eventually break down into stable zinc, although the penny’s appearance is not greatly changed. This radioactive copper emits electrically charged particles which can be counted with a simple electrical counting circuit. The actual count is made of electrons which* leave the copper atoms with an extremely high velocity. Traces Minerals The penny experiment itself is actually of little value to the Scientist. To the chemist and biologist the cyclotron has become a part of their equipment. It is used as a tracer of elements. By making the element radioactive and assimilating it into the blood stream, it can be traced throughout the body by counters. This method can be used with plants and animals as well as man.

Bachelor Born, Sing, Gymkhana Feature Mothers Day Week-End
Message To Mother Dear Mom ' For a long time now there’s been something we wanted to tell you. But sometimes it’s very diiRcult to put into words the accumulation of emotions that foster this desire. If we were artists like Whistler or Schubert, maybe we could tell you about it without words. Somehow they just don’t seem adequate. Perhaps if we tell you about what we feel you may get the idea. It has to do with a million little things, like those cookies that you always think about or that new jacket you know we wanted. Or maybe it’s just the way you intercede with Dad when we need the car. It’s all wrapped up in every meal we sit down to away from home. Nobody can make mashed potatoes taste the way yours do. And no one seems to know how to make noodles,
either.
Maybe it’s mixed up with the way you beam at us before your friends or the way you shame us into doing the job a little better than we have been. And then there’re the times when, as James Whitcomb Riley put it, “a feller needs a friend.” Somehow, a roommate just doesn’t offer the same comfort that you do. ' You like to kid us about the pretty young girls and the handsome fellows we run around with but believe it or not they don’t hold a candle to our minds’ picture of you. It isn’t the graying hair or the slowing step that we see but a roseate glow that we call Mother. You know it’s funny. These little things keep happening all year ’round but it just never occurs to us to tell you about them. We just sorta take it for granted that you know how we feel. Maybe it’s because we’re growing up now, getting to the point where we really appreciate all those “little things.” Anyhow, there’s nothing we’ve thought of yet, flowers, candy, or greeting cards that really say how much.you mean to us. It just can’t be done.

Like the monthly religious convocations sponsored by the University, the service is open to everyone desiring to attend. A “Purdue Mother” Mrs. Fitch, of the department of history and economics, was chosen to speak according to YMCA officials both because she is well liked by her students and because her daughter graduated from the University so that she is familiar with the University both as a parent and staff member. No events are scheduled for 11 o’clock so that the mothers can attend the services of their respective churches. Gymkhana At 2:30 The Gymkhana will open at 2:30 o’clock with a parade of all the entrants and will be followed in quick succession by a program of ten events including, besides the regular events, a diaper race, balloon bursting for women and a musical chair for men. Highlight of the show is the fivegaited horse class which is open to all amateurs. The closing events will be an amateur jumping class. Culver Military academy h6s increased the competition in this dass by entering a six horse team. Several Indiana Entries In addition to the Culver and local entries, horse fans from Crawfordsville, Monticello, Bedford, Cedar Lake and Michigan City have been entered. Judges will be Jess C. Andrew of West Point and Margaret Feore of Indianapolis. The show is free.

U.S. Will Adopt Firmer Policy Toward Japan, Capitol Reports Show By Edgar Ansel Mowrer Special Dispatch from Staff Correspondent Copyright, 1941 Chicago Daily News. Inc Washington, May 10.—Signs of the long-awaited ciystallization of American foreign policy in the Pacific are becoming so numerous that many people here expect some sort of tangible evidence of it from day to day According to nonofficial students of the Par Eastern tangle, this policy, in the nature of official hints and warnings, is-likely to consist of four parts: 1. A substantial shift in the disposition of the American naval forces might occur and the Pacific fieet take up a definitely defensive position towaid the Japanese, strictly coil elating its movements with those of British and Dutch naval forces in the Pacific. The fall of Suez might bring about a concentration of further British naval units in the Par East. The recent talks between Americans, Dutchmen and Britons in the Philippine Islands are widely believed to have served the purpose of correlating plans for defense should a Japanese move toward Singapore be undertaken. American strength in that region is considerably greater than it was. 2. Japan would he officially informed by the American government that this country does not intend to toleiate attacks upon Biitish and Dutch possessions The conviction IS firmly anchored in Washington that Biitain can be moie dangerously wounded at Singapore than anywhere else, outside the British Isles The United States will not permit such wounding successfully to occur, and would make this clear to Japan 3. American aid of all imaginable soit to China would be multiplied and amplified, as the Japs might learn to their cost. 4 Good behavior on the part of Japan would, however, be rewarded by continuance of present shipments of oil and other things, and this country would continue to accept Japanese silk It is even possible that Britain would go further and make new economic concessions to Japan in the South Seas.

Letters To The Editor
Dear Mom, It seems like I’ve been too busy lately with my work and my fun to write to you more than a few scrawled lines telling you that I’m well and that there’s a big dance Friday. Now, on Mother’s Day, I realize that it’s not often that I get around to saying “thank you” to you, and that my thanks have sort of accumulated throughout the past months. Even on my vacations at home I’ve talked to you little, except at mealtime. So when I wish you the very nicest of days today, and thank you for all you do for me and mean to me, I include in my thoughts all the thousand and one encouragements and bits of advice, and all the work you’ve done to help me toward a position in life. There have been times in the past months, in the past years, when I have done things that anyone but you would have found hard to forgive. Many times I’ve been thoughtless in what I’ve said and done. Too often I’ve accepted great sacrifices on your part without a word. I’ve neglected and forgotten things you have asked me to do. I just wanted you to know, Mom, that I appreciate, that I’m grateful for, your being my Mother and your doing everything possible in my behalf; I want you to know that I’m going to behave more like the person you would like to see me be m the days and yeais to come And, Mom, on this Mother’s Day, fiom the bottom of my heart, I’m proud of you —^Robert E.

Illusions
By Joseph Patrick Dolan Yesterday afternoon; those of you who braved puf fickle weather to watch Dutch Pehring’s baseball team in action saw the Purdue team playing that should have played all this season. It was a club ^ull of confidence from the bench to far center field. All we have to say is that it’s too bad the conference season isn’t starting tomorrow. —-I-I—. - , That last inning squeeze play is one of Fehring’s favorites, and the playing of Bud Fisher, Purdue captain, made possible that winning play-—without a doubt the most thrilling offensive play of baseball. Speaking ^of Fisher remipds me of the four hits Fisher got in the past two days—^four for seven. Now when you realize that the last real hit Fisher did manage to get was during the ’40 campaign, you can see the result of playing on new pasture, shortstop. —I-I— Maybe the other side of the hill is greener after all. Nice going, Bud. —I-I— Reading the papers last night of the terrific bombing that England has been subjected to for the past three semesters, reminds us of a^ interesting conversation we struck up with a former English athlete of Oxford University while we were at the Drake Relays last month. He told us that no sport was being played in his country at all., That this war was so much different from the last because of the long range striking attacks, was the reason for “no play in England.” —I-I— Those of us who swear, discuss^ and read golf can now look at one of the finest University courses in this country right here at Purdue,
Illinois Trocksters Bow Before Riveters, 68 T 58 Defeating a powerful Illinois track team, 68-68, the Boilermtiker thinclads scored their third dual meet vistory of the outdoor season yesterday afternoon on the cinder paths of RossAde Stadium. Captain Ed Holderman and burly Jake Weber led the victors, each taking first places in two events. Ed was the winner in his person- ^ ' . ' ■ ■ —•;

al duel with Park Brown, the Illihi captain, and beat the latter to the wire in the mile and the 880 yard run. In copping the mile run, Holdermah registered the good time of 4:19.2. His time of 1:58.2 in the 880 was also rather impressive. Weber cinched, his specialties, namely,: the discus and the shot put, without too much trouble. Rankin Downs Lewis Dave Rankin only took one first place during the afternoon, that in the 220 yard low hurdles, but he tied with Holderman and Weber for high point man on the'Rivetfer squad with 10 digits! Aside from winning the low hurdles, Dave came home with a^-second in the discus and thirds in the high hurdles and the shot put, respectively. It was no small feat for Rankin when

The Fighting Illini swept all three places in the broad jump, with Lewis’ leap of 22 feet, 9 inches winning.. However, the Gold and Black countered by taking all places in the pole vault. Britt was first in that event, followed by Carter and Grimm. Turner Leads Illini Turner lead Illinois in individual points by bursting the tape in front -of the field in the 100 and the 220 yard dashes, while Brown was responsible for nine points—one less than Turner; In addition to his firsts in the mile and the 880, Park was third in the discus.

Off to an early start this morning, six-Riveter golfers left at six o’clock for Ann Arbor with the avowed intention of arriving in plenty of time to rest up before tomorrow’s match with the Wolverines. The teamy along with Coach Allspaw and “Chief” Glevett, is traveling by car and shoiuld arrive on the Michigan campus early in the afternoon. Michigan, already victor over Ohio State and Indiana, is admittedly favored to prevent the Boilermakers from annexing their first Conference win. Earlier in the season the Riveters trounced Detroit but since then have failed to repeat with a follow up victory. Monday’s tilt will begin early in the morning with the doubles encounters. Three of the doubles matches will be played, with Riveter captain George Dahl and Roger Schutt composing the number one team, Charlie Curran and Bob Hoffer pairing off at number two, and Doug McDaniel and Wayne Knipp playing in the third spot. Ben Smith, leading the entire Michigan, squad, in the number one position, is one of the outstanding" sophomores in Big Ten competition • and at present is Florida State Amateur Champion. He, along with the Wolverine captain Fred Dannenfelser, are slated to play together as the number one doubles pair in Monday morning’s 18 hole battles. Only three lettermen returned to the Michigan links squad when the season began this year. As a consequence, the team has a prepon- - derance of potentially powerful, sophomore material such as, for instance, Smithj Bob Fife and Bill Courtright, all top-notch golfers in their own right. . All six of the Boilermaker linksmen will play in the singles matches to be' held in the afternoon from one until six o’clock. In the last meet in which the team participated, an encounter with the Hoosiers last Monday, the only singles victory for the Boilermakers during the day was chalked up by Bob Hoffer when he won over Indianai’s Van,
Horn.
After the tilt tomorrow the team will remain inactive until next Sat
the situation tdmorrow.
Netters Come From Far Behind To Hand Hawkeyes 5-4 Beating Yesterday afternoon, on the Riveter tennis courts, Coach Larry LaBfee’s netters gave a convincing demonstration of that undefeatable, never-say-die complex of all Boilermaker athletes. The final score of the meet, 5-4, although obviously close, gives no indication of the fight the home squad had to put up when they overcame a Hawkeye lead of 4-1, which piled up in the singles matches. ' • ■ ' Team Wins Two Over Week-end
Diamond men Beat (Continued from page 1) DeCorrevont. Bill didn’t make a hit in the whole series and redeemed himself in the ninth with a “shoe--string” catch that snuffed out a Boilermaker rally. Johnnie Emmert relieved Janisch in the sevnth and aside from performing well on the^ mound made a genuine fielding gem in the last of the eleventh round. With DeCorrevont on second, NU pitcher Bob Motl hit to Emmert who wheeled, touched out DeCorrevont and threw to first for a double play. Catcher Arnold contributed another good play with an unassisted double play. Added interest das contributed when the canvas back of the Riveter bench caught afire. The blaze was probably started by a cigarette or match accidentally thrown from the stands. Jimmy Rush jvas the hero of the little affair for he dashed up with the water bucket and doused the flames amid cheers from the fans. Base Stealing The Wildcats seemed to take advantage of Ernie Young’s injured finger, which was thrown out 6f place in Friday’s contest, for they stole three bases, knowing that it, was difficult for Ernie to throw. However, Young seemed to catch on to their antics in the last seven innings of the game by catching two of the Wildcats in the act of ingSampson, Purple left fielder, played excellent ball and registered nine putouts during the ganie. Bronx Cheers DeCorrevont was subjected to many uncomplimentary remarks from the crowd for his failure to hit but his catch in the ninth aroused a loud round of applause when he made the play and again when he came in to the bench. Blanken also made a nice catch in the second inning, going far back in right field to pull down Madsen’s fly: The box score is as follows:

Yesterday’s tilt completed a perfect week-end for the Riveter net squad. On Friday, Illinois Tech bowed low to a far superior Boilermaker team, which went undefeated to take the match 8-0. These two matches mark the last of the home tilts for LaiTy LaBree’s tennis stars. All of the others occur away fi'om home. Iowa competition, from the start yesterday afternoon, proved to be no laughing matter for the Boilermakers. Hawkeyes Butterworth, Parks and Grain, playing respectively number one, two and three positions, rather easily defeated Anderson, Stettner and Armstrong of the home squad. Grain did the job in two sets for the Hawkeyes while Butterworth and Parks each took three. Richards Scores Initial Riveter Win Richards, playing the number five spot, then took the first trick for the Riveters by defeating decisively Marshall of Iowa 6-3, 6-2. It was only shortly afterward however that Iowa’s number four man, Ryerson by name, took the fourth match for the Hawkeyes when he came out over Lucht of the Boilermakers by a score of 7-5, 6-1. At this point in the meet,, the lowans were far out in front with a thoroughly safe lead of 4-1, and the Riveters, to triumph, had to win all of the remaining matches; including one singles and three doubles tilts. They got started off in the right direction when Van Gamp trounced Wurl of thejHawkeyes in two sets. The first two doubles matches went off fairly easily in favor of the Boilermakers. Riveters Anderson and Lucht made short work of Crain and Parks by allowing them only one short game out of the two sets played. Incidentally Parks is, one of the smallest players in thft,. Big Ten, and was also one of the steadiest out on the courts yesterday. Match Set Goes To Ten Games The final match of the afternoon, with the outcome of the entire meet in the offing, saw Riveters Stettner and Armstrong pitted against Butterworth and Wurl Df the' Hawkeyes. Although the match went only two sets, the final one was by far the most bitterly fought of the day. The score soared to eight games apiece before the Boilermakers brdker through their opponents service to win the set and match, 10-8. The next encounter for the team occurs on Thursday when they travel to Columbus, Ohio for a meet with the strong Buckeye squad from Ohio State. j.s,k.

Britain Anticipates New Nazi Thrusts In 2nd Year Of War
Arnold D. Luers Receives
Ag Educaiion Society Key
By William H. Stoneman
SPECIAL CABLE To The Chicago Daily News Foreign Service. Copyright, 1941. Chicago Daily News, Inc.
London, May 10. — The first year of active warfare in the West ended this morning with a momentary lull in hostilities and with the promise that the coming year would bring a fresh series of violent episodes outdoing anything that the world has so far known. It is the considered opinion of both neutral and British experts that this new year will bring the invasion of Spain and North Africa, a heavy German attack on Egypt and the Suez, an attempt at invasion of the British Isles, increasingly heavy aerial attacks on British cities, and a greater U-boat campaign against British shipping than the Germans so far have been able to produce. Events of the last few days have also led to the expectation that Russia may throw its weight into the struggle on the side of the other totalitarian powers. Hope Lies With U. S. With 250 divisions under arms, the greatest air fleet in the world and a rapidly growing force of submarines, Germany admittedly has sufficient power to attempt all of the things that she is credited with planning. Britain, for its part, anticipates a number of heavy reverses in various parts of the world but still believes that it can prevent invasion. It hopes to hold its own at sea and gradually to increase the scale of its aerial warfare against Germany. But its real hope of success lies in the possibility that the United States will throw its full weight into the war in the immediate future and make the second year of active warfare in the West a fullout struggle between the totalitarians and the democracies. Anybody who said that American intervention was a necessity, one year ago today, was called a defeatist and promptly silenced. Anybody who does not admit it today is regarded as a complete fool.
Wednesday night the Agricultural Education Society held its annual spring banquet for the senior members in the Home Economics Cafeteria. The principal speaker of the evening was Dr. George Scarseth, an agronomist in the Agricultural Experiment Station. During the meeting Arnold D. Luers was selected to receive the annual honor key which is awarded to the student member showing outstanding ability and achievement in agriculture, leadership, and scholarship by the society. President John Conrad presided and group singing was led by Mr. Kellar Beeson of the Experimental Station, d.w.o.
