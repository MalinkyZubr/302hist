Playshop Selects Gregory For Lead
Last Chance To Reserve Choice Seats For “Carmita”
Edith Gregory
Dr. Eddy Flails Capitalism Dr. Sherwood Eddy in his address last night flailed the capitalistic system and dared true Christians to face the facts: to denounce the inequalities and. injustices of this world, as exhibited in the slum conditions of our major cities and the flagrant disregard of the health and character of the masses. - Speaking to approximately 300 persons in Fowler Hall, Dr. Eddy traced the causes of war, unemployment, and poverty directly to our economic system, and recommended a change to a form of communism founded on Christian-
ity.
Three Peace Threats
From his travels through Europe, Asia, and this continent, he has come to believe that the three main threats to world peace are Germany, Italy and Japan. Over population in their own territories have forced them to violent radicalism, which has been without the stabilizing effect of strong religion. Russia, in her coriimunistic reforms, has taken great strides forward, but the lack of religion has brought inhuman cruelties which no Christian can tolerate. Even in bur own country we have persC' cuted the labor blasses during strikes with bullets, tanks and lethal gas, and are gradually tend-
ing toward facism.
Dr. Eddy stated that to be a true Christian, one must dare to face these problems; to attack the underlying injustices incorporated in the Capitalistic system. If Christians fail in this duty, he sees the downfall of our civilization as the result of numerous impending
world wars.
Edith Gregory, playing the part of Melodie, a beautiful young girl with a baffling expression upon her fragile and wistful face, and Ada Mae Roe, as Clara, a good housewife with a haunted and wounded glitter in her eye, will take the leading feminine roles in Playshop’s newest production, “Behold This Dreamer”. Playing opposite these two will be Charlie Trees as “Charlie”, a young man with rather a spiritual quality to his good looks. Charlie is a dreamer. A man who I aspires to be an artist, and who desires to rise above his commonplace marriage with Clara, and a coinmonplace job in a brush factory, where he works for “Pop”, Clara’s father. Dicken Connor, remembered for his part in “The Pot Boiler”, will be featured in this
role.
Lunatic
The only ray of sunshine in Charlie’s drab life is Constance, played by RUth Grimm, to whom he goes for consolation, and with whom he fancies himself in Ipve. This slight respite from a prosaic life doesn’t last long, and when the artist begins to seek expression with dabs of paint ou a canvas, Clara and Pop have him consigned to an asylum. They are assisted by Mr. Harris, an insurance salesman, who is quite obviously drawn to Clara, though why, no one knows. The part of Mr. Harris is taken by
Thomas McCreadie.
While in the asylum, Charlie meets Melodie, who understands for the first time the true soul of the ai’tist,.. Also while there Charlie meets Tanneday, Blessing, and D. D. D., with whom he forms a close friendship. Tanneday, played by Bernard Everett, is necktie conscious; Blessings-One-by-One — Dick Robbins—who went to Sunday school too much as a kid, and D. D. D., a shell-shocked Veteran. The gentleman in charge of these crea tures is Piggies, played by Max
Harris.
The situations in which Charlie finds himself make an exceedingly funny and interesting play, designed to give the audience a full eve ning of entertainment.

L. von Harz. The Faculty Has The Honor-... The comparatively recent and foolish expulsion of a large group of North Carolina University students has temporarily turned the spotlight on the “honor” system of examination as used by many institutions. The system is used in quite a number of univerdties, and at the last medtihg of the National Student Federation, that group went oh record as “favoring the adoption of honor systems in those schools and colleges Which do not already have such systems”. From the reports of students at West Point and Annapolis, those two institutions evidently closely approach the ideal in the absense of regulations and this can be accounted for in the rigid standards that must be met to gain entrance. Washington and Lee, too, from the reports coming from that school, can be judged an outstanding example of a successful attempt to build up honesty as a tradition in the student body. Students from other schools using the honor system do not strike the same favorable note. Why? Those students who have no backbone, no object in college except to make a grade, are given an unfair advantage over the group that would play the game square. A recent visitor at Lafayette from an eastern college told an interesting tale concerning one of his classmates who took his examination home to type it. The paper Aoiald have been d^sed as. a thesis from the amo^t of research that was put in. As long as the present emphasis on grades continues to overshadow a student’s desire for an education, the honor system will continue as at present.,. with the faculty having the honor and the students using the system.

The school under the auspices of the Indiana University extension division, will initiate a program of graduate work in social service next September. This organization is a member of the American Association of Schools of Social Work, an association to which many of the leading schools in this field throughout the country belong.
The Yellow Sheet
These rafeeting, individual and group, will provide an ample follow up for the social service group meeting held during the Conference on Women’s Work and Opportunities in November. At tWs time Miss Edith, Abbott discussed the possibility of careers in the field with about 100 co-eds. Further intex’est has been shown by the social service committee of the Y. W. C. A. This g’/oup of 20 co-eds has carried out projects at the Cary Home and the Settlement House.
With the aavent of the present political administration the openings in the field of social work have become increasingly numerous. At the same time agencies, both public and private, are loathe to enjoy any workers who have not had professional training in the field.
It is with the double purpose of explaining to all those interested the openings in the field and the need for adequate training, that Mrs. Mow will interview aspirants to - careers in social service. —H. L. C.r
Some newspapers in this country, known as “yellow sheets”, make a practice of playing up sordid details and emphasizing sensational things in order to build up their circulatiohs. These papers may usually be recognized by the extremely large and flashy headlines, the large and black type used in their articles, and manner in which they attempt to appeal to the so-called baser instincts of the reader. Whenever a story is brought into the office of such a newspaper, those in charge look for the things which are most certain to attract attention, and give them prominent places. A divorce suit, a story about a college, or a “heart balm” suit often give, them some of their greatest opportunities to do this, and often they will make it a point to bring in some aspect of the case which has no direct bearing. One example of this appeared recently in a Chicago paper. Three young men, all of whom had, some years previously, attended universities, got drunk and, being mistaken for hold-up men, were shot. Instead of putting the important details in the headline, this paper referred to the three as “collegians”, even though they had been out of school for several years. Anything savoring of college life, especially in its more risque dr “fast” aspects, draws the attention of the reader, and the men who operate the yellow sheet know it. The reputation for loose living which many people credit to college students is a direct result of such tactics. By emphasizing the occasional cases of this type that are brought to light, and by passing over the more refined side of college life, these papers have led many to believe that such incidents are an essential part of the life of the student. And by giving especial prominence to the activities of college radicals, of whom there are comparatively few, these papers have created the false impression that colleges are hot-beds of communism and dissention. it is indeed deplorable that some newspapers feel compelled to style their articles in this manner, and it gives the intelligent reader the impression that they do not have enough worthwhile news to fill their columns. It is not surprising to find that those papers owned by W. R. Hearst are among the foremost exponents of this yellow journalism. If it were only possible to sue for damages because of the ruin done college reputations, perhaps such display might be eliminated. But Hearst and the others of his class are too crafty, and no libelous statements are printed, even though the inferences are often obvious.—^W. T. H. Chase S. Osborn, ’80, was honored recently by a columnist in the Cordelle (Georgia) Dispatch, when he was termed the only educated man in America, following a public address at a local church. The columnist defined one who is educated as, “One with a universal sympathy for everything and a certain amount of knowledge about everything that is known, and who still is on the line of evolution and is learning to,the end.”
Bob Kelly To Play For Tea Danee Tomorrow Bob Kelly and his orchestra will provide the music for a tea dance to be held tomorrow afternoon from 4 until 6, in the ballroom of the Memorial Union Building, The dance is sponsored by the Purdue Independent Association and only members and their dates will be admitted.

The biggest upsets of the evening were: Bill Skinner with Lustig and not Gregory, and Peterson actually out with Williams.

basketball career, three sen-! iors were in top form Saturday night to carry their teammates along in an overwhelming surge to a decisive victory. In addition to Capt. Kessler, who outdid all his previous performances of the season in collecting; 22 points, Austin “Red” Lambert and Ed Elliott turned in admirable performances at the guard and center positions, respectively, accounting for their share of the scoring, doing remarkable work in retrieving the ball from the backboard and blocking Iowa’s offensive attacks. Lambert played an especially fiery and skillful game at guard, breaking up Hawkeye drives
con'-.lstently. ■
Jiiii^^eWard, who started at the center^l^st, led off in the scoring soon afte!^he toss-up with' a field goal and a l^^e throw, closely fol-

All men who are entered for the Intramural Carnival boxing bouts must report to boxing ring on the gfm floor this afterhoon at 4 to weigh in and take a physical exam. Each man who expects to put on the gloves must take this physical once-over before he can step in
the ring.
A.fter the weighing in and other preliminaries are taken care of,, it probably will be necessary to run off several bouts to narrow down the number of contestants in the boxing. This was done yesterday afternoon in the wrestling matches. The number of men in each weight class was limited to four for Wed nesday night and as a result elimination bouts were held to deter-
mine the contestants.
a neia counter
called time out. W!^^ play was resumed Kes tallied twt^ore points from the field and a Yi%^throw in rapid order to increase th%margin to 10-0 after less than five miputes. Rosenthal, ace Iowa forward, then hit from the field for his team’s’ first score. Young soon connected for two more buckets and Seward for another to bring Purdue’s total to 16. Rosenthal, Schwartz and Suesens made a short rally for Iowa with one field toss each, and Rosenthal added a free throw. Young sank another for his fourth bucket and Downey was substi-
tuted for Malaska. Three Minutes Left
' With approximately three minutes left, the game developed into a free throw contest. Malaska left the contest on his fourth personal, Rosenthal making good the toss. Van Ysseldyk was also forced out in an attempt to stop Kessler going under the basket, both of Captain Kessler’s free throws swished the net, Young and Gaddis repeating with one each soon afterwards.
Young suddenly became deadly, scoring three buckets to bring his total points for the evening to 17, while Kessler adided his eighth field basket for a total of 22 points. With the game “on ice”. Coach Lambert sent in four new men. Sines, Bruce, Mangas, and Smith to replace Kessler, Young, Elliott and Lainbert in that order, as the crowd gave the victorious Boiler makers a tremendous ovation. Soon after the tip-off on the next play the gun sounded, ending the most spectacular home game, of the sea-
son.

Ilqny Chiarges AtWisconsin Officials Claim T1i€ Did : Not Violate Big Ten Conference Rules Officials at the University Of Wisconsin last night announced that they believed that they had done nothing in violation Of the rules of the Big Ten concerning faculty regula,tion of athletics, and that when the Board of Regents meets March 10 they Will begin to assemble evidence to that effect for the Intercollegiate Conference of Faculty Representatives of the Wostem Conference. The statement came as a reply to the committee’s charge, issued after their meeting at Chicago last Saturday, that “the evidence at hand establishes more than a reasonable doubt that the University of Wisconsin has that degree of faculty control required by members of the Conference.” The committee then passed a resolution requiring the faculty of the University of Wisconsin to notify th^m that they consider themselves in control of the athletic af--faifs of that institution before July 1, or the Badgers will be suspended from the conference. A committee composed of Professors G. A. Works (Chicago), R. W. Aigler (Michigan), and T. E. French (Ohio State) was appointed to confer with Wisconsin officials and to study the situation.

Squash Team Wins Four Out Of Five Awards Purdue’s squash team literally “brought home the bacon” from the Mid-Western Squash Rackets Championship matches in Chicago last Saturday when they won four of the possible five awards made. Chicago, Northwestern, and Lawrence College opposed the University team. J. D. Lucek was the individual star of the meet, and went through without a defeat to win first place in the contests. The final round of the matches was an all-Purdue affair, with Lucek and H. G. Noll fighting for top honors. Each man won two games, then Lucek came through in the fifth to clinch the championship. Noll automatically won second place. Another all-Purdue contest occurred when Ulrey and Tzucker met to decide the thh’d place winner. Ulrey. won three straight games in gaining that position. ‘Frosty” Fields, who was defeated in the first round of the meet, won a fourth cup for the University when he defeated Havesides of Lawrence College in a match for the consolation prize.
