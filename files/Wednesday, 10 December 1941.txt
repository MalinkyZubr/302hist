'peiified Forest'On Fowler Hall Stage
I ■ By Bill Hoskins
jitfeiiqcre performan^^ of Sherwood’s dramatic production, “'the Petrified Forest,” was/presented in Fowler Hall last iiigiit as the Playshop group swung into its second night, attenipting to combine suspense, a philpsophy of life, love, and
gun play into ninety minutes.
A well-balanced cast, with better than average acting in the'bit parts, depicted the story of a lonely gas station-ham-burger joint on the edge of the ' ——
Petrified Forest, where attrac- * rough - talking Gabby *u.<ple, portrayed by pokerfaced JUnet Pecker, was living a life bf mental starvation and supr6ssed desire.

Victory In War Against Japan (Special to the Purdue Exponent)—Speaking from thb White House over a nation-wide radio hook-up, President Franklin Roosevelt last night assured the American people that “we are going to win the war and we are going to Vnii the peace that follows” and fulfill for ourselves and our allibs “our hopes and their hopes for liberty under God.” - Mr. Roosevelt began his 25-minute address with a genbrai review of the present situation and a brief reference to the history of our 88-year relationship with Japan. He cited tbe —-— —— many aggressions of the Jap-

New Kind of Game In Local Cornfield By Walt Rafert Stuclerits. who spend their leisure time hunting are not returning empty-handed these days! Latest substitute for small game was furnished , yesterday by Joe Sunny, freshman engineer, and Joe Allcgrettei ME ’43, when they returned from a cornfield ten miles north of the campus ■with a cigarbox affair that was indentified as an experiment sent up by the meteorology department of the University of Chicago. Attached to the box was a red silk parachute, and the remains of a red balloon which apparently had carried its cargo to this vicinity. The box contained several unidentified glass tubes, with notice of re\vard for anyone finding the box and returning it to its source. The ycwai’d was of more value than any local game, but the hunters offer proof that the prize was not shot down, or mistaken for potential I’abbit stew, w.e.r.
Howitzer Squads To Hold Competitions Tomorrow Finals for the 166 mm. howitzer squad competition will be held in the Armory tomorrow at 7:30 p.m. The squads are composed of sophomores, trained by junior officers. The winner is chosen by an inspection of the personnel and tests of their knowledge of ipatcrial and service of the piece. With the exception of pneumatic tii'cs and high speed axles, the guns are Identical to howitzers used by the United States Army. The 166 mni. howitzer shoots a ninety-five pound shell 12,000 yards. The contest is open to the public. Fred Conger ... a University staff member from WBAA will speak tomorrow afternoon at 4 p. m. to the current affairs group of the YWCA in room 305 of the Union on “Radio Propaganda.”
Editor Encourages As Usual” Attitude It is often said that those who know, the least talk the loudest and longest. Now that war has come to America, we can see here at onr own University the truth of this statement. Monday members of the Exponent staff interviewed administrative officials of theiUniversity, who all said that they knew nothing concerning the status of Purdue students and the pnrt the University will play in this conflict. Furthermore, these executives would not hazard a guess as to the future. They are the men. who will soon know what is ahead of us, but at present they are unable to predict anything. , However, there are members of the,faculty who have presented in class periods their predictions of the war-time role of Purdue and its students. One professor said that the RGTC boys will be graduated in January and handed their commissions at that time; another believes that the University will be converted into an army barracks before June; and an engineering professor said that a good majority of the students will be drafted into the army by January .These statements are absolutely absurd; they are nothing but wild
On Part Of Faculty guesses, and have no factual basis. If high University executives won’t even attempt a gi^ess concerning the future, how can instructors and professors make statements like these? ■ ^ President Elliott yesterday asked that Purdue men and women attend strictly to their usual business as students, but it is difficult to “study as usual” in the face of the professorial opinions being issued in classrooms. True, these predictions are only opinions, but the average student is in the habit of accepting his teachers’ beliefs as correct. As long as this condition exists, faculty expressions on the war similar to the, ones mentioned are going to have a serious effect on student morale and will aid in the spread of the “what’s the use” attitude that University administrators are attenipting to prevent. We believe that students of Purdue should make every effort to prepare themselves to perform the services needed, and that this effort will be seriously hindered by faculty members who insist upon' filling their class periods with rumors and idle war chatter. When student duties in this war are determined, we, the students, will be given tbe proper advice by the proper authorities.
University Debate Team chalked up its easiest victory of the season thus far when the scheduled debates with Illinois yesterday was cancelled by their/prospective opponents. However, for the benefit of the students taking Speech 14 and 16, two University debate squads argued the following topic: Resolved, That every able-bodied citizen of the United States between the ages of 18 and 21 should have at least one year of full time military training before reaching the present draft age. Affirmative Side The affirmative side stated that we'Were at war with not only Japan but with the axis powers. They also stressed the fact that we have an army of only one and a. half million men whereas the present selective service law calls for an army of four million njen. They suggested as their solution that the age limit of the selective service act be lowered to include the able-bodied male citizens between the ages of 18 and 21. Negative Side The negative side argued that we must look after our own national defense, and that an increase in the army at the present time would handicap our lend-lease program. 'They also stated that an inci'ease in the Army would “dilute the officer personnel until no one would be well trained.” Prof. P. E. Lull of the speech department announced that the University Debate Team will oppose the Ohio State University team tonight at 7:30 in the Home Economics Building, r.l.m.
ernments during the pa.st feh years, all made “without warning,” “It is all of one pattern. We are now in this war ; we are all in it,” he concluded. In referring to the all-important news policy of the wartime goy-' erhment, Mr. Roosevelt said • that it “will give facts to the public aa soon as two conditions are fulfilled.” The^e conditions he cited as depending on when the facts ate definitely confirmed and when their release will not prove valuable i(o the enemy in any way. “We wlTl not hide facts from the country n we know facts and if they will hot be a help tq the enemy,” he said.
Foreign Policy
After reviewing the American, foreign and domestic policy diheie ^ the collapse of France, he said tl^t “that policy has been justifted, has given us time to buijd our Assembly lines . . . That is what these 18 months have given us.** ■ / ’ “It will not only be a long war, but will be a hard war,” Presidfht Roosevelt stated. He mentidhdd ' plans now underway to Spheidl industrial production which elude a seven-day production wee)c> the building of more plants, and the full use of old plants and sihAU
plants available.
Hard Work Ahead “On the road ahead there lied hard work, gruelling work . . . 'ife United States can accept no result: save victory . . . There' is no such thing as security for anything or any person in a wprld ruled bjf* gangster principles,” he continued; As to our official attitude regarding Germany and Italy at the predent time, the President said that we must “remember always, regardless of any declaration of wari that Germany and Italy consider themselves at war with the United States at this moment.” f.iij.

Mouse Executes Major Coup In Quest Of A Midnight Snack
By Bob Bos winkle A lowly storage room mouse left his humble habitat in the-foundry of Michael Golden Shops Sunday evening in search of a midnight snack. Somehow the rodent’s search landed him inside one of the molds which two instructors spent three hours apiece making Saturdaj'^ afternoon. » The mold was one which was' made to east a plaque which will be placed on the old Physics Building. The cunning creature sensed that food lay in store for him inside the mold, and with that treasure in mind he bmu'owed under the tin covering over the sprue hole and trotted across the delicately molded sand over to .the side of the walls. Pulls Dunkirk Theye the hungry mite gulped up much of the flour paste that was spread on the upper and lower parts of the mold to hold them together.
Then the mouse pulled a Dunkirk. Professor Lindley of the general engineering department said that he had never he.ard of such a thing happening before, and R. E. Wendt of the foundry division described the dastardly attack as most unusual. Who’s To Pay ? The mouse’s damage is likely to cause more of a headache than is at first apparent,, for GE officials are in a dither over what they are going to charge the cost of making another mold up to.' Certainly the mouse will keep hidden after he reads this. University officials are anxious to state, however, that even though the surprise attack on the mold was timed perfectly with the' Japanese incident, it is not to be construed that the ihouse’s intent was sabotage. _
Ceres open meeting will be held tonight instead of tomorrow night as was erroneously stated in yesterday’s Exponent. The meeting will take place at 7:30 p.m. in room 363 of the Union Building. Herman Steen is the speaker, his subject being “What Happens to Wheat After Harvest.” Included in his talk is the relation of quality characteristics of wheat to the products made. Mr. Steen, a graduate of Iowa State,- was formerly on the editorial staff of the Prairie Farmer, and several other farm papers. He is director of the Wheat Flour Institute in Chicago, and in that capacity, has done a great deal of research wqrk. Both Mr. Steen and W. Floyd Keepers, a director of the Educational Division, who will also be at the meeting, are well known by many members of the University staff. Everyone is cordially invited to attend this meeting and to bring others with them, c.e.w.
