New Plan
Mote Students Able To Go Home At the regular senji-month-ly meeting of the Executive Committee of the University last Monday afternoon, the Committee approved the Student Senate’s recommendation that the school program be suspended on July 3,1942, giving the students a short vacation period in addition to July 4. . At the Senate's last I’egular meeting, the Vacation, plan was proposed and passed. Joe NefF, Senate President, presented the recommendation to the Executive Coun-
cil,
Content Of Recommendation The recommendation reads as follows: “Inasmuch as we believe that the value of improved student morale would far outweigh the value of one day’s work in the school program, we, the Purdue Student Senate, do hereby.recommend that the Executive Committee of the University make Friday, July 3, 1942, as well as Saturday, July 4, 1942, a vacation period.’’ Because Independence Day, July 4, falls on Saturday, and a vacation for this day only would have meant little to the students, the Senate took its action. The recommendation was made as provided in the Senate Constitution; however the Senate had no legislative power in the matter. Provides Time For Traveling This brief rest period, coming thus in the middle of the semester, should offer students a welcome relief and permit, many of them to jourriey home and visit their parents who would have been unable to do so othei'wise. YWCA To Sponsor Tea For Freshmen Coeds In Union Today At 4 iToday at 4 in the West Faculty Lounge of the Union, YWCA will sponsor a “get acquainted” tea for the new freshmen, transfer coeds and their counseloi's.

Membership Drive At the tea, a di ive for new member.s for the “Y” will he held. The l)rice for a momhership card will lie $1 foi' two teinis, and YWCA will be active this summer. Activities sponsoied by YWCA include a number of intei'ost discusV;ion group.s'which oi)erate all year in the organization. Among these are social service, leligious, arts and crafts and music groups, which have discussions monthly, and woi'k out projects in these fields. Summer Plans C<»mpleted 'rhis summer a series of “grooming” programs will be given. Included in these is a style show where new costumes, diess outfits made by. campus coeds, and madeover garments in keeping with the war schedule for economy in clothes will be exhibited. The officers of the “Y” are Vivian Peterson, president; Carolyn McCrary, viee-jn'esiifent; G i n d y Hague, secretary; and Chan Ball, treasurer. All Setiiprs Musf Sign In Debris Office By Friday All students who expect to graduate in either August or December, 1942, must register outside the Debris office before 5:30 Friday uHernoon.

Now they would attempt to put the yoke on us—on you. It must not happen here! Whatever the cost, the Axis must be smashed. Your part, as a college student, is clear. You may not be behind a gun today, but you can help today to give our soldiers, sailors, and marines the weapons they need for Victory. Put your dimes and dollars into fighting uniform now by buying United States Savings Bonds and Stamps. You’ll help not only your country, but yourself—because you are not asked to give your money, but to lend it. You can start buying Bonds by buying Savings Stamps for as little as 10 cents. Start buying today—and keep it up!
