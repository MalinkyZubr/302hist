Rabbi Jacobson is a graduate of the University of Cincinnati and of the Union Theological Seminary, also in Cincinnati. He has spoken at gatherings throughout the country at various times under the auspices of the Jewish Chautauqua Society. Rabbi Jacobson’s subject Sunday afternoon will be “The Ages of Reason”. He is noted as an excellent speaker, and was featured in last' year’s Institute program. The summer session chorus will sing two anthems, “Now the Day is Over” (Joseph Barnby) and “Give Ear to my Prayer” (Jacques Arcadelt). H. I. Metzger, University organist, will accompany. Stewart To Take Leader’s Role At Second Song^est Community singing and a special program by the Purdue Summer Chorus will provide entertainment for the second summer songfest to be held in the Ross-Ade Stadium next Wednesday evening at 8 o ’clock. Albert P. Stewart, director of musical organizations, who has been studying in Chicago this summer, will return to the campus to appear in the triple role of master of ceremonies, leader of the group singing, and director of the summer chorus. One of the innovations of the program will be the use of two pianos on all group songs. The pianists will be Edith Mills, secretary to the music organizations, and Robert Phillips, student director of the concert orchestra. Xylophone Solos Added attractions will include two xylophone solos by Neil Carson, of West Lafayette, who will be accompanied by Arthur Jacklin, West Lafayette. Carson will play “Liebesfreud” by Fritz Kreisler and “The Dance of the Comedians” from the opera “The Bartered Bride”. Another soloist will be Eugene Finnegan, of Lafayette, who will play a violin selection “The Old Refrain”
With Summer Prom permit distribution on the 430 mark last night and still going strong, student promoters of the summer’s capital social affair decided to extend the deadline for obtaining permits another 24 hours. Exponent’s business office—room F of the Union—^will remain open from noon today until 8 p. m. only to continue issuance of permissions to buy tickets for the dance. Results of these three days at the permit desk proved assertions of enthusiastic Summer Session students concerning financial success of July 29’s formal dance, and dispelled doubts of conservative staff members. Bands Easy To Get Negotiations for a Prom orchestra are getting underway immediately. No haste was considered necessary in obtaining musicians for the night, since good bands are

easily available for a single engagement during summertime. Sully Mason, ticket chairman, said last night he would place the $2 admission slips on sale the first of next week. Classroom announcements will notify permits holders of ticket sale opening. Ted Cabonargi, in charge of decorations and features, promises unique lighting effects as the chief decorative theme of the evening. Lights for this purpose can be gotten at little cost, Ted says . . . practically all income from ticket sales will be spent on music. Refreshments Planned Placing tables outside the Union Building on the lawn and serving refreshments there is planned for Prom goers. Other entertainment features are being considered. Students in charge of Prom answer questions concerning dress for the affair with the statement that men may wear almost any sort of sports or summer formal suit . . . women, of course, will dance in long dresses. Dean of Men M. L. Fisher last week approved 9 to 1 o’clock dancing hours.

Bud Bryant will bring his local orchestra back to the campus tomorrow night to play for the third Summer Session mixer in the Memorial Union ballroom from 9 o’clock until midnight. The group has just completed an engagement at Ideal Beach. With Summer Prom replacing the mixer scheduled for July 29, this dance will be the last mixer of the summer. The price is $1 as usual. WBAA Will Try New Vocal Cords Tomorrow Purdue’s radio voice, WBAA, will try out some new vocal cords early tomorrow morning when it goes on the air for a special testing program to last from 1 to 2 o’clock. Many bits of new equipment will be added to the station’s transmitter, and through the advice of the Radio Corporation-of America, which sold WBAA the equipment, this special testing broadcast is planned. A letter fp^ RCA recommending such^^ocedure wa,s received at the WBAA studios Tuesday.
Elward, Baugh Return From Tour Of Eastern, Midwestern Alumni Clubs
Football Coach Mai Elward and Eth Baugh, executive secretary of the Alumni Association, returned last week from a three weeks' tour of eastern and middlewestem alumni clubs. Made for the purpose of introducing Purdue’s new head coach to alumni, the trip took Elward and Baugh to Anderson; Columbus, Ohio; Pittsburgh, Penn.; Washington, D. C.; Baltimore, Md.; Philadelphia, Penn.; New York, N, Y.; Winston, Conn.; Boston, Mass.; Pittsfield, Mass.; Schenectady, N, Y.; Rochester, N. Y.; and Akron, Ohio. The pair left June 16 and returned July 1, after having greeted the largest turnout ever experienced in several of the alumni clubs. The
procedure at these visits was usually according to the following schedule: Golf tournament in afternoon, radio broadcast befoi'e dinner, banquet, election of officers in business meeting, then speeches by Baugh and Elward. Elward Tells Prospects Eth Baugh told alumni of campus changes, growth of enrollment, campus activities, and gave them the latest news concerning alumni affairs. He then would introduce Elward who told about next year’s footba,!! prospects and the results of spring training. The programs usually wound up with the showing of campus movies, close-up movies of football players, and pictures of last year’s PurdueIndiang game.
Lecturer Outlines Ways Of Bettering Community Specifications of the “good life” for man were presented to the 1,050 convogoers who gathered in Eliza Fowler Hall Tuesday morning to hear Columbia University’s Dr. E. L. Thorndike. Psychologist, Author, and Educator Thorndike had printed handbills listing 26 of these specifications distributed, then spent most of his hour-long talk explaining and enlarging on them. The text of those specifications is printed in the twocolnmn box below. After finishing the 26 items. Dr. Thorndike delved into a discussion of social justice, liberty, equality and fraternity. “Liberty,” insisted Dr. Thorndike, “is valuable only insofar as it means relief from needless oppression. It is for the common good that some parts of a group always coerce other parts.” . Equality Is Fantastic “Equality taken item by item is a fantastic goal. There are good men and bad men, great men, and little men, and we can’t do much to change them,” pointed out Dr. TAorndike. As the conclusion of his talk Dr. Thorndike enumerated 37 items pertaining to the welfare of the community.'* “Four fifths of the things important ,in improving communities are accounted for by the income of the people and their personal qualities. Two fifths are* represented by their personal qualities, one fifth by their income, and the other fifth by things common to both. Consequently it is' two and a half times more important to make the people better than to increase their incomes.”
Publication Dates Exponent will publish Summer Seission issues on following dates; July 21 and 28, and August 4 and 11.
Dr. Helen Reid Does Double Duty Monday Dr. Helen Dwight Reid, of the University of Buffalo, will do double duty next Monday as she leads the afternoon forum and speaks at the morning convocation. “Dictatorship vs. Democracy ” will be the topic under discussion at the forum which wiU be held in the Memorial Union Building beginning at 2:30 p. m. Eleven o ’clock classes will be dismissed Monday morning for the convocation which will be held that hour. This will be the last in the series of five Summer Session lecture convocations.

Influence Of Athletics Is Boxer*s Topic Gene Tunney, former world’s heavyweight boxing champion, who is now a successful business man in New York City, will discuss ‘ ‘ Athletics and Their Influence on Civilization” as the principal speaker before the annual Summer Session banquet tonight. Tickets for the banquet, to which the general public as well as members of the student body are invited, will be available at the Memorial Union desk until 9 o’clock this morning. The banquet is scheduled to get underway promptly at 6:30 o’clock and judging from advance ticket sales, a crowd of approximately 400 persons will attend the unique occasion. Schmadel To Sing It was announced last night that, prior to the banquet, guests will be entertained in the lobby of the Memorial Union Building by soprano solos by Alberta Schmadel, of Lafayette. Miss Schmadel, who was enrolled as a special freshman student in the University last year, was recently awarded a scholarship to study voice at the Arthur Jordan Conservatory in Indianapolis next year. Tunney, following boxing successes during his seiwice in the world war, rose rapidly to fistic fame, winning the world heaAWweight championship from Jack Dempsey in Philadelphia on Sept. 23, 1926, and successfully defending his title against Dempsey in Chicago a year later. After making an estimated million dollars in the year, Tunney retired and entered business in New York. Always known as a student of literature, he has appeared on numerous educational programs in recent years. Hannigan Here Tunney will be accompanied by Steve Hannigan, former Purdue student and native of Lafayette, who is recognized as one of the nation’s leading publicity men.

Valuable Collections ... ... of birds came to the University museiHii in the Biology Building this week, as a newsstory in today’s paper announces. Especially noteworthy is the Amos Butler Collection, which represents the most complete bird assortment in the state and is estimated to be worth $3,000. We wonder what permanence these collections will meet in, Purdue’s museum. . A certain allotment of money is set aside for the upkeep of this room in the basement of the Biology Building, but we doubt, from appearances of the place, whether it is an adequate amount. And no person is charged definitely with keeping the exhibits in good condition, or with cataloging and indexing the various specimens. It is the experience of museums where no one is definitely in charge that the specimens tend to disintegrate and disappear due to the ravages of various museum pests. Yesterday afternoon we stopped in the Biology Building to look over the new bird collections and the museuin in general. There we found the museum door locked, and learned that no arrangeemnts for accommodating visitors were ottered other than for them to call at the office and wait until someone gets time to go dovm and unlock the door. We finally saw the Butler Collection—placed away in steel cabinets for study purposes—and thoroughly admired the specimens and the work entailed in gathering and keeping records on 3,222 birds over a period of some sixty years. We saw other things in the museum, how^ever, which were much less admirable. Even our inexperienced museum eyes could discern undesirable conditions in the room . . . bird specimens which looked as though feathers had dropped out, and in some cases as if tails had fallen off . . . insect collections being destroyed by insect pests . . . fluid in bottles of preserved specimens gradually evaporating to the point where the specimens may dry ui). Conditions in the University museum are not extremely bad at the present, but they indicate a state of inaintenance which may cause a great deal of damage unless sufficient funds and the tiine of a person trained in museum technique .are made available. More space for the museum is also needed, as brought out by the removal—because of room limitations-—of other specimens to make way for the two new collections. The University'museum includes a fairly complete exhibit of local birds, reptiles, Ashes, and mammals, and representative forms of most of the invertebrate

groups. It also contains extensive mineral collections, assortments of arrow heads, and exhibits of various Indian implements. We believe that this museum—principally one of natural history—is inadequately utilized as an educational tool. In the future growth of our University, adequate care should be taken to see that the museum is developed to meet the needs of the institution.

Well, well, well ... . . . only three more week-ends until PROM. Apd have you noticed the female inmates of the University holding big guzz sessions over the queen proposition ? Ted Cabonargi thinks there should be a male Atlas contest held in connection with the Prom queen affair. And it’s rumored that Bert Morgan has already decided who is to reign over the Prom, and is taking definite steps for the gal’s election ! Time will tell. OF COURSE..: . . . the logical person to have as queen is one of the CAREER WOMEN school marms. After all, it’s their campus this sumniei’—so why not let them have their fling. De holds is yammerin’ in de trees, De skies is filthy wit stars; Cheze, Babe, Ain’t Nature a lead pipe cinch? The BIG AFFAIR of the season was Cec Isbell’s birthday party last Saturday at Barton’s Beach. Most of the guests( ?) ended up covered with chigger—or was it jigger^— bites. Only 62 gallons were consurhed! And what kind of moths wrecked the clover emblem on the Kappa Sig lawn? Looks like a case of domestic jealousy, boys.

Monday night at New Haven, Conn., Gene Tunney refereed a fight between a colored lad and a white chap. The fight was very close, with the negro getting the nod on points. The crowd greeted the decision with a lusty chorus of boos. Then the unpredictable Mr. Tunney pulled the unexpected.
Basketball Schedule League Standings
Lists 12 Home Games
National League
Twelve home games, including six conference eiteounters, make up part of the 1938-39 schedule for Purdue’s Big Ten basketball title defenders, as announced today by R. C. Woodworth, acting athletic director.
The former champ called for silence, stepped to the p.a. mike, and proceeded to explain why the colored boy was the winner. “I (Tunney speaking) know as much about boxing as anybody here. Now if anyone cares to disagree with me just let him step up.” You guessed it; the auditorium was emptied quicker than the most ambitious fire inspector could imagine. That’s the same Mr. Tunney who will speak at the annual Summer Session banquet tonight—the same Mr. Tunney who hates newspapermen even worse than Col. William Terry, of the Coogan Bluff Terrys, does.
It isn’t often two such attrac-

tions as Tunney’s talk and the American Association All - Star game are offered Hoosier sports fans, but that’s the menu for tonight. We were told we could have all the ice cream and pop we want at the All-Star affair—^we’ll be in Indianapolis tonight. The All-Star will win easily if the Indianapolis Indians don’t hurry up and find a pitcher who can get past the sixth frame. —PC— We have been asked by a number of persons if the present winning streak of the Pittsburgh Pirates is a record. The modem record (since 1900) is 26 consecutive wins by the New York Giants. The Cincinnati club holds the all time record of 60 straight victories — that was back when each team played 60 games a season rather than 154. -PCFree advice to Charles Q. Grimm (still manager of the Chicago Cubs): Why not let Phil Cavaretta pitch? Besides he can hit, too. A couple of years ago Phil pitched so well his team reached the finals in the Chicago high school baseball championship. Incidentally, Felix Mackiewicz, now third baseman on the Purdue nine, opposed Cavaretta on the mound in the finals.
In defending their conference championship. Coach Ward Lambert’s speedsters will meet Indiana, Illinois, and Wisconsin in home and home games, play Northwestern, Michigan, and Chicago at home, and Iowa, Minnesota, and Ohio State away.
The pre-conference schedule, which will match the Boilermakers against seven of the strongest nonconference teams in the game, will be featured by a home game with Southern California during Christmas holidays, and a trip to New Orleans to meet the University of Arkansas in the Sugar Bowl classic game.

“I made up my mind to get a MODERN refrigerator regardless of cost. Imagine my delight when I found the price of Coolerator, the air cohditioned refrigerator, was a hundred dollars under many less up-to-date kinds. My foods are fresher, more delicious, and I’m saving money every day.” Coolerator keeps foods fresher because air conditioning provides four essentials of ideal refrigeration: 1. Constant Cold. 2. Positive one-way circulation. 3. Balanced Humidity. 4. Washed Air. Instead of costing more, these advanced features cost you LESS. If you want fresher foods at less cost, investigate Coolerator!

Educational Leaders Attend Clinic
Student Guidance must be approached with extreme caution, declared Indiana University’s Dr. E. S. Conklin, Monday afternoon in one of the leading addresses before the opening session of the Educational Leaders’ Clinic which will be in progress here until Saturday. Approximately 150 educators are registered and attending the regular morning, afternoon, and evening sessions of the Clinic.
Cadets Open Fire With '37' Shells By Milton Reeves Exponent Correspondent Early Tuesday morning everything we have been studying for the last three years at Purdue in Military Training 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 suddenly took definite meaning as we opened fire with the 37 mm. guns. The 37 shell doesn’t do nearly the damage that a 75 mm. shell does, but it certainly makes a loud report upon firing. When the command to fire comes down, everyone in the firing battery automatically jams his fingers down his ears to deaden the effect. Fire Service Ammunition After two weeks of this subcaliber practice, we will fire regular service ammunition for the duration of camp. Tuesday, a week ago, was the first day we had our noon meal in the field. For the first two weeks we ate all three meals in the mess hall, but now that we have started firing we will eat midday lunch in the field quite often in order to utilize every possible moment on the range. When we were issued our mess kits at the beginning of camp, I had my doubts as to whether they would accommodate enough food to give me that comfortable, satisfying feeling one should have after a hearty meal. My fears were dispelled immediately after our first meal in the field; I consumed so much food and drink that I crawled under the cot of one of the trucks, used by canteen for a pillow, and spent the remainder of the noon hour quietly sleeping it off. Serves First Guard I served my first guard duty Wednesday morning from 2 to 4 o’clock, and I’m still a little footsore and weary. There are five guard posts in the ROTC camp area. The guard detail consists of five sentinels to walk the different posts and a corporal of the guard who has the duty of seeing that none of the sentinels go to sleep on their beat.
Dr. Conklin pointed out, “Pupil guidance calls for more training, more knowledge, and more wisdom than most teachers ever achieve. In handling human beings there is always a large unknown. Theoretically, guidance should be possible, but practically there is very serious danger of unintentional error because few, if any, persons are ever fully competent.” Speakers Today School Superintendent Carleton Washburn, of Winnetka, 111., will speak on “The Philosophy of the Progressive Education Movement in America” at the morning session today, while Roscoe Pulliam, president of the Southern Illinois State Normal University, will deliver the main afternoon address. Pulliam’s subject will be “The Philosophy of the Essentialist Movement in American Education.”

WASHINGTON Cross-Comitry Bound . . . . . . this week, President Roosevelt is combining speech-making with sight-seeing as he pushes circuitously toward the Pacific coast in his special train, stopping here and there to confer with Democratic leaders and to pat favored primary candidates on the back. Every night this week will be spent on his train until Saturday when he boards the cruiser Houston at San Diego for a deep-sea fishing jaunt in the vicinity of the equator. Vacancy . . . ... in the United States Supreme Court created by death last Saturday of Associate Justice Benjamin F. Cardozo may remain unfilled until Congress meets next January, according to latest speculations of Washington politicians. Although President Roosevelt may appoint a justice when Congress is not in session, the Senate must finally pass on his selection . . . and some think the President may avoid possible embarrassment by having that body vote before any nominee actually takes his seat.

Tuesday they nominated a state ticket fob 1938 elections and at the same time presented a candidate for presidential nomination in 1940. United States Senator Frederick VanNuys, now reconciled with state Democratic leaders, won renomination by acclamation. All other nominations went through without a contest in the shortest convention in the party’s history—2 hours and 51 minutes. Pandemonium broke loose on the convention floor when National Committeeman Frank McHale read a plank in the platform “proudly” presenting former Governor Paul V. McNutt, now high commissioner of the Philippines, as candidate for the presidency in 1940.

Publicity-artist Grover Whalen christened the “flying laboratory” “New York World’s Pair, 1939,” just before Hughes nursed it into

The playtime of the year — and what a disappointment if your car won’t run. First there is the lake — you’ll miss that swim and the boats, perhaps even the fish.
