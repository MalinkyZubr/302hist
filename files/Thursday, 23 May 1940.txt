CAAFlightTraining Will Continue Next Year At University Applications Are Received Now In Personnel Office G. Stanley Meikle, director of research relations with industry, and head of the University Airport, announced yesterday that the University was authorized by the Civil Aeronautics Authority to continue its flight training program during the next academic year starting in September. Offering of both the preliminary and advanced flight training was approved, with at least fifty students to be taken in the preliminary course and the number in the advanced course not given. Meikle also stated that Purdue students who wanted to enroll for the flight training should make application now at the personnel office in the executive building. The completion of the preliminary flight training is required for enrollment in the advanced course. Fifty University students took the flight training last Spring, another fifty are completing the same work now and nine men are enrolled in the advanced course. Varsity Nine Licks Stubborn Freshmen Squad In Slugfest Handcuffed for six innings by frosh pitcher, John Janisch, the varsity finally cut loose on Leifeit in the seventh and hammered him for 8 runs on 6 hits and an error to win 18-10 in last night’s freshman-var-sity game. Coupled with the yearling’s fagged fielding, the varsity scored 8 runs on 7 hits, a homer, two doubles and four singles. Besides allowing 7 hits, Janisch, slender speedball slinger, walked only two men and fanned 8 regulars in the 6 frames he hurled. Pound Bailey Combing Bob Bailey, the varsity’s ace, for 8 runs in the first three innings, the hard hitting frosh captialized on 10 hits to score 10 runs. Hitting honors on the freshman side were garnered by Crumley, carrottopped .first sacker, who collected two singles and a triple, while Carson, fleet footed fielder, hit two singles. Slugging laurels were copped by freshmen McCaffery, Smith, and Frazier who hit a home apiece. Onfhe varsity’s side of the ledger, Smithson run away with the hitting by connecting safely four times, one a four bagger. Following Bailey to the mound was Higgins thwarted the rhiriie’s attack by allowing only a run. But the frosh counted a pair in the ninth on two successive four base blows. Final Tilts This week-end the Boilermakers will conclude their schedule by playing a two game series with the powerful Illinois Wesleyan nine on the home field. Friday’s game will start at 4 and on Saturday the umpire will call out, “play ball,” at two. This series will terminate the collegiate careers of Riveter’s Mackiewicz, Hearne, Smithson, Vernon, (Continued on page 2) SCA Gives Final Dance Saturday Student Cooperative Association will hold its last dance of the year Saturday, May 25, in the faculty lounges of the Union.

Richey, state NYA administrator, announced today. More than 3,200 students representing all of the 92 Indiana counties but one and nearly 1,100 out-of-state students are working on the NYA college work program in 41 Indiafia colleges and universities, Richey said. - Purdue university leads all of the Indiana schools in the nteiber of NYA students, but Indiana university has students from one more county than Purdue. Marion county, which has the most NYA students of any county, 429 in 26 schools, also has the largest representation in any one school, 140 at Butler university. Other counties with large groups of NYA students are Lake, 237; St. Joseph, 198; Vigo, 164; Allen, 120; and Tippecanoe,
104.
Indiana schools with the largest number of NYA students and the number of state counties represented are Purdue, 877 students from 88 counties; Indiana, 861 students from 89 counties; Ball State, 199 students frdm 58 counties; Butler, 178 students from 17 counties; Manchester, 59 students from 23 counties; Tri State, 55 students from 17 counties; Central Normal, 49 students from 23 counties and Earlham, 49 students from 13 counties.

Museum Houses Interesting Collection Of Railway Relics
Situated directly east of the power plant is a sheet-metal building rarely visited by the University students. Housed in this building, known as the railroad museum, is an historical collection of locomotives and other railroad appliances, which were gathered by the late Dr. W. F. M. Goss, dean of engineering. Dr. Goss, with the aid of several railroad officials, succeeded in gathering an interesting and instructive group of relics, which are representative of the early days of American railroading. The oldest and .most interesting locomotive in this collection is the Tornado, a full-sized reproduction of the second locomotive used on the parent line of what is now knoAvn as the Seaboard Air Line. This faithful reproduction of the original which was in service about 1845, is only 15 feet long, with a fire box, which is located at the rear end of the boiler, resembling a tea-kettle because of its high, dome-shaped top. This museum piece was presented to the University in 1902 by the Seaboard Air Line. 1858 Locomotive Another in the collection is the Reuben Wells locomotive, built by the old Jeffersonville, Madison, and Indianapolis Railway Co. in 1868. Named after its designer, Reuben Wells, the locomotive and its tender are constructed in one solid unit, with large water tanks running the complete length of each side.
The oddest locomotive to be found in the museum is the Winan’s Camel Back Locomotive built in 1868 by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. Deriving its name from its unusual shape, the engine was in active service until it was started under its own steam on its trip to' the University, arriving here in November 1901 after a five day journey. The cab, which is located midway between the ends of this locomotive, resembles a small house with windows on all sides. In order to fire the engine, it was necessary for the fireman to go down several steps, guarded by a banister-like hand-rail, in order to reach the coal pile in the tender. A wooden awning over the front end of the tender afforded the fireman some protection in bad weather. The two remaining locomotives in the collection, the “Eddy” locomotive, built by the Boston and Albany Railroad, and the Chicago and Northwestern locomotive No. 6, built in 1873, are of similar construction and are representative of the railroad motive power used in this country during the latter part of the nineteenth century. An 1833 passenger coach and an 1868 locomotive, both part of the original collection, have been removed to the World’s Fair in New York City, where they are now on exhibition.

Three WBAA Men Will Sargent Meet Wisconsin Team In Radio Quiz Friday
Gilbert D. Williams, program director of WBAA, announced last night that a team of three University senior men have been invited to compete against a team of three University of Wisconsin co-eds in a quiz on geography on the prog'ram “This Amazing America” aired by the National Broadcasting Company Friday evening at 7:30. The students, Harry Bischel, Benny Burns, and Hank Miller, will be the guests of the Greyhound Company, sponsors of the program, during their short stay in Chicago. The program, which is heard in this tei'ritory over station WLS, is broadcast coast to coast over a network of 80 Blue Network stations.

The University will be host to officials from all parts of the state. Labor’s responsibilities and opportunities will provide the general theme of the significant two-day session. The session will be called to order Saturday morning by John Acker, vice-president of the state organization. One of the highlights of the opening day will be an authoritative discussion of proposed Social Security amendments. This topic will be discussed by Robert Watt, of Washington, D. C., international representative of the A. F. of L., and Clarence A. Jackson, executive secretary of the Indiana State Chamber of Commerce. Labor’s place in the vocational education program will be presented by George W. Dean, Michigan Director of Vocational Education. President E. C.

Both boys are favorites of the airways. An outstanding point of the orchestra’s eleven year history is the fact that the organization has remained intact with no personnel changes during this entire period, the band being an authorized corporation. Glen Gray is president and each member is a stockholder. They all share in the profits. Soil Scientists, Ceres ToHearLowdermilk “Soil Erosion and Civilization” will be the subject of an illustrated lecture by Dr. W. C.

Thompson Will Speak On National Defense A short address by Captain P. W. Thompson of the University military department will be given over WBAA Friday, starting at 3:45 p.m., on the subject of national defense and the opportunities offered young men by our army.

Captain Thompson will tell of the many advantages the modern army holds for ambitiobs young men seeking a career. 800 Debris . . . will be ready for distribution in the Debris office and workship in the Union tomorrow at 4 p.m. All partial payments must be made immediately.
Notre Dame Enters Strong Squad; Fay Defending Champ Over a half hundred aspirants from ten Indiana colleges are entered in the Indiana Intercollegiate tennis tournament which will be held on the Riveter courts today, tomorrow and Saturday. Following a coaches’ meeting this morning at 9 to match the entrants, competitive play will begin an hour later at 10. Notre Dame has a group of outstanding racqueteers who rank as pre-toumey favorites, including last year’s singles champ Bill Fay, John Joyce, last year’s runner-up, and Daniel Canale, outstanding sophomore who has been playing the No. 1 position for the Irish team this season. Rough Road For Irish However, the Irish stars must face a strong group of 48 other challengers before any of the trio can lay claim to the singles crown. The Boilermakers boast a strong list of entrants, a team which won victories over Indiana and Butler during the regular season. Earlham’s squad, which has been for the past several years host for the meet, is not as strong as in former seasons, but should be able to give the players of the larger schools plebty of competition. DePauw also has an outstanding squad, hating won victories over both the Riveters and Maroons this season. The Tigers defeated the Boilermakers by a single point in a hotly contested match earlier in the week. Fay And Canale Seeded Twenty-six doubles combinations will seek the two-men crown during the two day’s play, with the Irish duo of Canale and Pay the strongest seeded favorite. One of the strongest pairs bidding for the championship is the DePauw combination of Souder and Hanna. Last year Souder teamed with Linsay to cop the state doubles crown. Providing the weather man gives the go sign, the matches will be played on the courts north of the Ross Ade Field. Having this large number of courts available for tourney play will eriable the run off to procede much faster than has been the case in previous years. Ten Schools Here The ten schools entered in the tournament are: Indiana, Purdue, Notre Dame, Earlham, DePauw, Anderson, Ball State, Manchester, St. Joseph, and Butler. The seven Boilermakers playing in the tourney are Captain Herb Fuente, Jim Hebbeler, Don Anderson, Fred Richards, Ray Lucht, Bill Berg, and Bob Meihaus.

A sweep of the two-game series with Ohio State this week-end would insure the Purple of an undisputed title. Illinois, its season ended with nine wins and three losses, Michigan, and Minnesota, retain mathematical chances for the title or a share. Northwestern has won eight and lost two games. Iowa, defending champions and with a current record of six Wins and two losses, has been eliminated from title contention with two games remaining. George McKinnon, the fiery shortstop whose extra-inning double blasted Iowa’s title hopes two weeks ago, rapped out seven hits last week-end to pace the Northwestern attack and come within two percentage points of the Conference batting leadership. Bob Smith, Wis-^ consin third baseman, holds the lead with an average of .441. His single appearance last week, as a pinch hitter after a leg injury had forced him out of the line-up, brought an added base hit. Northwestern’s other two leaders are Bill DeCorrevont, who slid off his record slightly to an average of .395, and Nick Conteas, hitting ,372. The Purple team average is .285. His season completed, Walter “Hoot” Evers of Illinois apparently has slugging honors for the year to himself. His final average of .363 was built on 18 hits for 37 bases and he accounted for 16 runs with his bat. James H.Cissel . . . CE ’10, professor of structural engineering at the University of Michigan, is the author of a textbook on “Stress Analysis and Design of Elementary Structures” ^- ing published this year by John Wiley and Sons, New York.

An ■ llusions By Joseph Patrick Dolan Did ya notice those batting averages on the Exponent’s front page yesterday. No they weren’t the St. Louis Browns, they belonged to the hit-starved Boilermaker club that potentially was a powerful outfit before the season got under way. However strength on paper doesn’t always apply, it’s something like theory. Ah yes, theory. —I-I— Did you notice co-captain Mickiewicz’s average of .275? That’s his average for both conference and non-league activity. His conference average is just a little more than three goose-eggs. But there’s another story to it. —i-r— I’ll venture to state that if all the robbed hitters in the big ten were lined up according to the base hits that have been snatched from them by larson-minded fielders, Mac would be at the head of the class of those heart-broken batters.
Time and time again this season, Purdue fans have' seen Felix slam towering fiy balls or drives deep into left and center, only to have some acrobatic outfielder maneuver into a, position to cuttle the little horse hide. We hate to see such a ball player as Mac slam balls all over the orchard for naught, because he’s such a conscientious ath- . lete. -I-I— Mackiewicz ends his great college diamond career this week end with the last two games of Purdue’s current season being played this Friday and Saturday. George Doherty, junior Purdue outfielder, broke into the Purdue line-up yesterday and collected one for three. George always seemed to be a good batting practice hitter, but yesterday showed that he could stay with the rest of the Purdue outfit. An average of .333 for a game ain’t bad for any Purdue ball player. —-I-I— Dutch Fehring’s a wonder drillmaster, sets up situations that may never occur, but once in a ball players career but his kids are definitely drilled in fundamentals). It’s too bad Dutch can’t go to bat for the byes.

Michigan Defends Crown
Indiana Strong Contender mini Annex Big Ten
Golf Championship
By Phil Johnson
Michigan's powerful championship cinder squad will seek their fourth consecutive Big Ten championship this week-end as the Western Conference track championship goes on the block for the thirty-ninth time Saturday afternoon in Northwestern’s Dyche Stadium. Only once before in the history of the conference has a team annexed the title four consecutive times, the Wolverines having won it the first four years of its existance, from 1901 through 1904. The nine other teams comprising rated a good chance of retaining his
the strongest all-around conference in the country will have full representation at the meet Saturday to challenge the Wolves’ right to continue to wear the diadem. Probably the strongest challenge the Ann Arbor boys will have to overcome will be that of the strong Indiana
team.
Hoosiers Potent The Hoosiers enter the meet with an outstanding array of stars, led by the well known trio of Kane, Cochrane, and Harris, who could win as many as seven blue ribbons Cochran is the defending titleholder of the 220 yard low hurdles, and also is a super quarter miler and a broad jumper of no mean ability. The Hoosiers will also boast another defending champion in the person of Roger Poorman, whose defense of the javelin title will be seriously handicapped by an arm
injury.
Wolves will probably be suffering the distinct handicap of being without the services of their captain and stellar distance man, Ralph Schwarzkopf, who has been suffering a strep throat since the Drake Relays. However, an added ray of hope is given to their chances by the return to top form of sprinter Alan Smith, who has been suffering from an injured ankle. 440 Dash' Tossup With their captain out, Michigan will have only a single defending champion in the meet. Warren Breidenbach, 440 yard dash artist, is
title, but will meet with strong competition from Indiana’s Cochran and Riveter Shackleton. Although it is the consensus of opinion that the Hoosiers and the Wolves will probably fight it out for the first two places, the remaining eight positions are in pretty much of a muddle. Wisconsin, who finished third in the indoor meet is a definitely strong contender, with Minnesota, Purdue, and Ohio State also boasting strong combinatiops.
Buxton Returns
The Badgers have one defending titleholder, half miler Ed Buxton, along with Smith in the hurdles, Williams in the pole vault, and Paskvan in the weight events. Boilermaker coach Hermon Phillips plans to take a squad of 15 men to the conference meet, headed by such stars as Captain Shackleton, Holderman, Rankin, Weber, and Tycocki. Holderman, who has been undefeated in five dual meets; will rank as a strong contender in the half mile and the mile races. There is a possibility that if the Michigan distance ace does not compete in the two mile affair. Coach Phillips will enter Holderman in the longer distance event.
Tycocki Favored
Tycocki has run the fastest furlong in the conference this season, and will be a strong contender in the century dash and the broad jump. Weber has the second best shot put toss of the Big Ten this year, and is expected to battle with
A quartet of University of Illinois linksmen upset the dope bucket to win the Western Conference Golf Crown Tuesday afternoon with a team score of 1,245. A strong Wolverine team finished in second place with 1,254, closely followed by Minnesota and Ohio State with 1,262 and 1,268 respectively. Ohio State’s Bill Gilbert, a sophomore from Cincinnati, became the first Buckeye golfer in history to win individual top honors when he nosed out Michigan’s Bob Palmer by a single stroke with a score of 298 for the 72 holes. Eight strokes back at the start of the final 36 holes. Palmer steadily cut down Gilbert’s lead, until at the end of the 69th green they were tied. They halved the next two but on the last hole, which Gilbert made easily in par. Palmer, by virtue of a too powerful 60 foot chip shot, took a five and lost the match. The Boilermaker individual standings in the meet were as follows: Hoffer, 173-85-86—344; Dahl, 176-78-82—326; Curran, 166-81-82— 329; McDaniel, 167-81-89—337; Skinner, 182-89-83—354; team total, 1,336. The Riveter team finished in ninth place.
Harris and Paskvan for the putting title. Captain Shackleton will be one of the leading contestants for the quarter mile and will run as anchor man for the relay team. Rankin should run strongest in the high hurdles. The Boilermaker team is one of the strongest squads ever to enter thb conference meet wearing the Gold and Black, and should be able to land a position well up in the final standings. Last season the Riveters ended in fifth place behind Michigan, Indiana, Wisconsin, and Ohio State. '

Final Examination Booklets
. . . which were printed for the use of the students in preparing for finals are still on sale in the cashier’s office in the executive building. According to Harry Layson, Student Senate president, only a few students have taken advantage of the opportunity afforded in the use of these booklets. This spring, the Senate brought the idea of these booklets before the University. University officials apparently thought well of the idea because they financed the plan. Photostatic copies of final examinations in several schools were made and bound into volumes. Examinations in the following schools and years are available: book 1, finals in all required courses for freshman engineers; book 2, final examinations in all required courses foi sophomore engineers; book 3, final examinations in all required courses for junior and senior mechanical engineers; book 4, final examinations in all required courses for home economics freshmen; book 5, final examinations in all required courses for agriculture and forestry freshmen and agriculture sophomores; and book 6, final examinations in all required courses for freshmen, sophomore, junior and senior science students. The practice of publishing final examinations in book form is not a new idea. It has been practiced at several other universities with considerable success, both from a scholastic standpoint and from a practical standpoint. From a scholastic standpoint, examinations in booklet form, available for students to use at their place of study, are of great value. A student is able, by studying the final examinations, to get a comprehensive idea of what he is expected to know in each course. From a practical standpoint, booklets of examinations for individuals will alleviate a great deal of the congestion in the library during final time. The crowded conditions which naturally result from the large number of people studying final examinations is not conducive to good studying. Many students copy the examinations and work out the questions at home. It seems to us that these booklets are much more convenient and practical. Each one of these booklets which have been published may be purchased for $ .50. Neither the University nor the Student Senate is making any profit on the booklets. They were not published for profit! But they were published for the convenience of the students! Take advantage of this opportunity!
Another semester, a new Exponent staif, and with it a new B & B editor. Nope, this is not Prexy Elliott. We can’t figure it out. Finals so close and things still go on like always. —B & B— Joe Rose, SAE pledge, and Helen

Ripping Through the Duquesne Duke we ran across this little item . . . The Purdue Exponent Catches the nod this week in regard to an article on their fror.“ page. The article starts out with a head to the effect that the “Typical Sorority Girl Prefers Cokes, Bright Nail Polish; Knits.” Well, that’s all right, but further down in the article they clainl that the proverbial Purdue ratio is four men to one woman. Now if both statements are correct, and, although there are four men to every woman, the women still have to knit, there must be something wrong with the Purdue men. Or could it be the women ? Let’s say it’s the latter.
We have been looking over the improvements on the campus and we have come to the conclusion that there is one phase of campus life that has been definitely neglected. The pencil sharpener.
For quite some time we have suspected that University officials are in cahoots with the makers of automatic pencils, judging from the absence of pencil sharpeners on the campus. Not only are the darned things very scarce, but the ones that we do have are very conveniently located. So that we can’t use them. o
Heard This One? A few contrasts compiled by Much Foo. May come in handy sometime for that English theme. U. of W. Va. Daily Athenaeum.
We Stole This from the Dakota Student of N. Dakota University: The royal flush is said to be reflected in a few faces down Stanford way. During exams recently a bunch of boys in the dorm were having a little poker session when they heard a knock. “Who the devil is it?” one of the boys yelled. , The knock was repeated. “Well, come in.” They came in—the president of Stanford and the prexy of Rochester University. Dr. Wilbur of Stanford had wanted to show his colleague what a typical. Stanford dormitory looks like.
Take the one in the mechanical lab. A very fine pencil sharpener. It’s out in plain sight where anyone can find it. But try and use it. Right behind it is a pipe. The only pipe within twenty feet. Every time you turn the handle your knuckle' hits the pipe. People have even worn the paint off of the pipe. The University must have gotten wind of this, because a little man just came in and whispered in our ear. He told us why the University puts the pencil sharpener against the pipe. It lasts longer there.

We have been reading about the war in the papers, but we never got very serious about it until the other day. We read that civilians were organizing an “antiparachute troop” detachment. In Pittsburgh.
It is getting along toward the end of the month when all of us are rather low on funds. Orie girl we heard about has been broke for the last week or so. The other day she got a box from home. She opened it expecting to find a cake, fried chicken, or some similar gustatorial delicacy. Instead she found cut tulips. Her remarks were flowery.

Here’s A Little extraction from the movie critic’s column of the Dartmouth: Ecstasy Despite all the protestations of the Audio-Visual Department, the appeal of “Ecstasy” to a Dartmouth audience comes not at all from its symbolism or pictorial beauty, but rather because it has the reputation of being a competent sex show. Which is just as well, since the film is neither good sym-, holism nor very pictorial. It has Hedy Lamarr going through an Ann Corio routine, which is as rare as a solar eclipse and much more entrancing.
