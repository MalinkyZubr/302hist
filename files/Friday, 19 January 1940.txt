Donham Appointed Head Of Veterinary Science Department Appointment of Dr. C. R. Donham, professor of veterinary science at Ohio State University as head of the department of veterinary science at the University was announced yesterday by President E. C. Elliott following the two day quarterly meeting of the University Board of Trustees. The board also approved leaves of ^bsence for two staff members. Miss Starley Hunter, of the home economics extension staff, for graduate study at Columbia University; and George 0. Mott, of the agronomy staff in the experiment station, for graduate study at Cornell Uni-
versity.
Dr. Donham was graduated from Iowa State College in 1921 and engaged in private practice for a year. He then went to Oregon State College where he remained for seven years on the staff. ' From 1929 to 1935 he was on the staff at the University of Minnesota, and since 1936 has been on the faculty at Ohio State University. His research in the treatment and prevention of Bang’s disease has brought him wide renown in the veterinary pro-
fession.
Considerable time was also spent by the Board of Trustees on business in connection with the new buildings on the campus. The board inspected the new additions to the Union building, and also the new sections of Cary Hall.
Plans have been made to offer the course at 11 O’clock on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday of each week. The course carried with it three hours of credit, and will probably be listed as History 130, according to Dr. Estey. Regular attendance will merit a “B” grade, it was also learned. The course has a catalogue name, “America’s Role in the Pacific,” although “material taken from the recent past, along with the handling of news of current interest in lectme and discussion may not adhere strictly to this formal title,” Enders intimated iman interview. Enders is an accomplished lecturer, having given over 125 lectures during the past two years before outstanding groups in the country. He has been foreign advisor to Chiang-Kai-Shek and other Chinese leaders. Enders has written several books, including “Nowhere Else in the World,” a copy of which is in the Union browsing room. Two years ago he spoke before the annual science dinner, and was interviewed in a broadcast of one of Dr. Robert Phillips’ government lectures. Upperclassmen interested in registering in the course should consult their advisors prior to, or at registration.
FACULTY MEMBERS The regular monthly meeting of the faculty will be held on Monday, January 22, at 4 p. m., in Stanley Coulter Hall. A full attendance is expected. EDWARD C. ELLIOTT.

Most of the rushing will probably consist of luncheons, over-night parties’, breakfasts, or informal dinners. The eight national sororities taking part in rush are Alpha Chi Omega, Alpha Xi Delta, Chi Omega, Delta Gamma colony. Phi Mu, PiBeta Phi, Kappa Alpha Theta, and Kappa Kappa Gamma. Pledging may take place at any time during this period of rush. Contrary to first semester rushing, nO quota for the number of expected pledges will be set.

Radcliffe Offers Co-ed Fellowships

Two fellowships, worth 600 dollars each, are being offered by Radcliffe Gollege, Cambridge, Mass., to senior co-eds interested in personnel administration. The awards are for the term beginning July 1, 1940 and ending. June 18, 1941. Training offered at Radcliffe in personnel work is unique, as the curriculum is adapted to the objectives of each individual student. Students may prepare for careers in private industry, government agencies, or educational institution. Additional information on the fellowships may be obtained from Miss Houghton, director of Women’s placement service.
She went on to stress the importance of maintaining good mental health as well as physical health during finals. Aboye all, she urged the co-eds not to waste 'their ehergy worrying, since it only clouds their minds.
Co-eds should make R special effort to get plenty of sleep. If possible, they should ha've more sleep than usual, rather than less.
Doctor Rose warned girls against following the advice of their friends on how to live during finals. Co-eds are urged to consult the Health Service immediately if they should become ill. / '

Aquacade Stars Totiive Another Show to Fietdhouse Pool Wednesday, Jan. 24 Providing a sequel to the thrilling “Aquaqade Varieties” show h^d htefore a pair of capacity clrowds Jast i)eceml;|er 16 19 in tihe J’ieidihouse pool, Swimmini^ <5oach ’Dick Papenguth has an^duhced thjat another such bit of hiarine entertainment will be presented Wednesday nighty jfanu^iry ?4. The show is being planned ?n apswer to a number of demands by members of the annual road school, which will convene here the week of Jan-
uary 22.
Stars Return Most of the stars of the first production have been secured for a retprii engagement, including Adolf Kiefer, Patty Aspinal, Lorraine Bemid, and Barbara Cook. The only top-flight name that will not reappear will be that of Larry Griswold, comedian, who due to previous commitments will he in Florida at the
time.
Both Patty Aspinal and Adolf Kiefer will be seeking new world’s records in the breast stroke and back stroke, respectively. Last month, Patty, who is only 13 years old, turned in an excellent performance in her attempt to beat Catherine Rawls’ record in the 300 meter breast stroke. Egged on by the cheering spectators, Patty fairly flew through the water in 6 minutes, 6.2 seconds to tie the national women’s record. Water Ballet Another feature of the earlier show which will be brought back is the water ballet, staged by the TrL top Club. A water polo game bet\;^een the varsity team and the ineligible members of the squad—and there are plenty for a full team—
will also take place sometime during the prdgram. At last acquacade, four state records were broken and one national record tied. The afore-men-tioned Patty Aspinal provided the main fireworks in the .national mark busting department,, while four Boilermaker swimmers did their part to break down a few Indiana A. A. U. records. All of the last shoiy’s mark-busters will be back Wednesday night to see what they can do about bringing those times even lower. Interspersed throughout the program of swimming, diving, and comedy, will be several novelty acts put on by the Riveter swimming .squad members.

Illinois, who was picked by many sports writers at the beginning of the season to share blue ribbon honors with Indiana, has proven the most unpredictable of the ten quintets. ' mini??? —

Both of these players have seen plenty of action already this season, and have shown speed and fight. Vernon is a senior, and Caress is a sophomore with two more years of action remaining for him.
Officials Announce Plans For Football Clinic Here In April Between four and five hundred high school college gridiron coaches from Indiana and neighboring states are expected to gather here for th§ ninth annual Football Clinic. The parley, to be held here on Friday and Saturday, April 6 and 6 takes place every year in order to give the coaches an opportunity to discuss gridiron developments with some of the leading authorities in the game. Carrying out the policy of the last eight meetings, the Purdue Clinic, pioneer gathering of its kind, will again feature practical information designed to be of immediate value, and at the same time allow ample opportunity for lound table discussion and individualized instruction on particular problems.
In addition to the members of the Boilermaker gi-idiron staff, headed by Coach Mai Elward, a number of outstanding collegiate and high school mentors will be on hand to assist in putting on the two day program. There will be lectures and demonstrations on virtually all phases of the gridiron game. Members of the Riveter squad, which lost only one Big Ten game last fall and finished in third place m the conference standings, will Serve as models during the field demonstrations of various fundamentals. In addition, two picked teams fiom the Boilermaker squad, which will be in the midst of spring training, will take part in a regulai game at the wind-up session on Saturday afternoon, April 6. Banquet Planned One of the featuies of the weekend will be the annual coaches’ banquet on Friday night, April 5, which will be followed by a round-table discussion session for both coaches and officials.
The mini fought Indiana’s powerful five in a close battle at Bloomingrton, with the Hoosier’s winning 38-36. Bill Hapae, captain of the Illinois team and their leading scoring threat, was forced to remain in Champaign while recovering from an attack of the flu. The next Monday night Coach Doug Mills’ squad lost prestige in a battle against Chicago, the weakest team in the league, when they were only able to eke out a one point victory. l^ive days later the faltering IIlini, despite Hapac’s return to service, were snowed under by an Ohio State five who had previously lost four straight games. Then, on last Monday night, they pulled one of the major upsets of the season by defeating a. fast stepping Michiga^n team to drop them into a second place tie with Indiana. Northwestern Northwestern seems to be a close second to Illinois for an unorthodox showing, as the Wildcats, undefeated in preconference games, have proved somewhat of a disappointment to Northwestern fans. The Purple lost their initial conference game to the league leading Boilermakers, only to come back and easily defeat the Minnesota Gophers, the giant killers who knocked Indiana from her pinacle. The Wildcats followed this victory with a 4428 win over Chicago, only to slump again last Monday night against an improved Ohio Sjtate five to lose by a single point, 32-31. The Boilermaker’s seem to be the only team in the conference, with the single exception of Chicago who has lost four straight battles, about whose status there can be no doubt. The Riveter’s are leading the Big Ten in all departments except individual scoring. Their total scoring is 14 points higher than their closest rival, Michigan. The Boilermaker’s have rung up a total of 188 point^in four

games in contrast with their opponents 131, an average victory margin of 14.2 points per game. They have scored 46 times £r<»n the free throw stripe with a four game average on charity tosses of 64%, an average second only to Ohio State with a one per cent higher efficiency. England Leads Scorers Only in individual scoring must the Boilermakers take the back seat. Sophomore Don Blanken, the squad’s leading point getter, is 12 places below the leader. Gene Englund of Wisconsin. However, the fact that the Riveters do not have to depend on a single scorer, but have a balanced scoring potentiality gives them a far better chance of remaining at the peak of the toughest hardwood conference in the nation than any of the other Big Ten members. Eight Big Ten teams will see action during the mid-semester holidays against non-conference foes. With both Indiana and Chicago meeting the strong DePaul squad, a team beaten only once thus far in the season, an overtime battle against Chicago; with Northwestern and Illinois meeting Notre Dame’s fast improving quintet; and with Michigan and Wisconsin meeting Michigan State, it seems highly probable that Big Ten supremacy will not prove itself in all cases, and that some of the conference teams may fall before such strong non-conference competition before they resume Western Conference activity on February 10.

By Gk>rdon Fletcher To wish you, the students, good luck is about all anyone can do at exam time. Someone else can’t make up for the classes you have missed or learn the whole course for you in two days of concentrated study. But why should they ? There’s nothing better than taking stock at a semester’s end (both before exams and after grades have been published) of all the hours you have missed. It comes in as a handy excuse. Everyone knows that if he had just gone to a few more classes or applied himself a bit more, his grades would have been higher. Concentrated study is strictly a one man job. If someone could help you in it, half the feeling would be gone, for to take the job, the helper would have to be one of those ambitious persons that believes in a Schedule. Start work at 7 o’clock. Rest from 7:55 to 8. Study for an hour with good light, ventilation, and a neat desk—-and so on till 11 o’clock when it’s time to sleep. All true crammers abhor such conditions. The lack of schedule for a day includes a movie in the afternoon, a liesurely dinner, a date till 11 o’clock, and then study. A smoke filled room with the radio blaring make ideal concentration media. To study previous to the night before an exam is sacrilegious. More than three hours sleep is unheard of. Off and on for the past several years there has been a lot of talk about abolishing finals

and basing grades on work done throughout the semester. Any crammer will have a thousand arguments against any such proposal. It takes the spice right out of collegiate life. He feels that during the year school work should not interfere with education. Then, as it is necessary to get through, a few days of concentration will soon be lost in post-exam days. The rules that get Doc Miller a by-line twice , year don’t have much bearing on the true crammer. He knows the dangers bf his profession and never resorts to the use of drugs. They interfere with natural sleep. A head cradled in tired arms is the most comfortable position. Drugs,keep this from happening. Only the amateur has false ideas about such things. Sometimes doubts assail him. The roommate that has studied during the semes(;er invariably gets better grades, he never ha^ to worry about what to tell his parents just before marks go home. However, he can always fall back on the reasoning that his roommate isn’t living dangerously. It’s hard enough to live a life of this type at school, but the crammer is approaching it. Ten years later who’ll know the •difference?

The Exponent, in its policy of bringing the best to its readers, publishes below a list of the NICE things that a student can do during exam Week. Students in these dark and gloom-filled times are apt to forget that all is not study and cram, but that someplace “the sun may be shining.” These are some of those places: 1. Bill Martin and his band will play tomorrow night at the Union’s regular Saturday night mixer, from 9 to 12 o’clock. 2. There will be mixed swimming and recreation in the Women’s Gymnasium tonight, from 7 to 9 o’clock. i 3. You can always try the theatres. 4. Visit the Union; it’s nice, and quiet now. 5. If you find anything else to do that’s NICE call us, will you ?

>9 "UERrS MORE POWER TO INDIANA
A New $6,400,000 Power Expansion Progra
m
City homes are demanding more convenience and comfort . . . rural living is demanding relief from burdensome tasks ... industrial activity is expanding rapidly. All three are creating new and constantly growing responsibilities that our $:ompany must meet with an adequate supply of electric power. In a broad sense the service must always be ready for tomorrow. That is exactly what we are doing now . . . building a new electric generating station (an addition to the present Dresser Station near Terre Haute) and connecting transmission lines, at a cost of
^6,400,000, which will generate 50,000 kilowatts of electrical energy per hour to meet the growing needs of homes, farms and industry of Indiana. Whether the power is needed to energize an electric refrigerator in a home, to run a milking machine on a farm, or to operate a giant motordriven stamping machine in a factory, the Public Service Company is bringing flexible, reliable electric power to Indiana, in constant and abundant quantities, always anticipating today’s needs, always getting ready for tomorrow's. More Power to Indiana!
