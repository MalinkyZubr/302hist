From where we stand, it looks as .thoU'gh a Maxw^liah idea tvas been wa,sted oil d^^ ert aiiv Some time ago, the author of “Second GlimpsOi’!: suggested that the regular Good Canteens might be replaced by Sports Gaiitbens, now that summer weather is ph tho , way in. But nothing has been done in the matter to date, as far as we know. . The idea of Sports Canteens is full of poSsibililiep.. While Coed Canteens did offer Opportunities for good entertainment, all serviceiSbtf weren’t dancing or card enthusiasts. N^rly everyone, however, has a favorite sport and is in the mood for it during spring weatW. Facilities here at the University are numerousi' Tennis racquetders have the Women’s Gohfts," the courts behind the FieMhouse, and thosb, behind the Stadium at their disposal. Swimming, badminton and ping-pong , are to be found in the Memorial Gymhasiiim, and there are archery ranges near the Women’s , Courts. Baseball is in order on Intramural Field or the plot near the Armory, and the ’golf course is another possibility, ' ^ For those whq don’t care for the more vigorous sports, hikes into the country provide fresh air and exercise; The afternoon, as an example, might end with t;he servicemen assi^ed to a certain house and the girls all meeting together for a picnic. ^ Admittedly this would take sohie planning, but it would furnish an excellent outlet fop all that first-of-the-season exuberance. Perhaps r Student Senate, into whose realm Canteens come, has already given this idea consideration. If not, we submit it as one of those inspi^Toiis which shouldn’t be buried in Nthe 61d|Exponent files.—p.m,
