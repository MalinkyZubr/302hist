I^esi Tcache/s Award Response
recipient of the Best Teachdr
Sigma belta Chi, professional journalistic fratepiity. The members of this group have no desire to thrust their own opinions upon the student body, and so have asked a number of timfes for suggestions as to who should receive the award for 1944. , ' From the response which has been received so far, however, it seems as if the^ are few , persons bh the campus interested enough in good teaching to bother recommending anyone. ‘
of stimulatihg views which probably represent a crosssection of the American people on the question of birth and war.. , Here are thtee of the letters—^from a soldier, a mother and a grandfather—expressing the hopes and fears with wiiich they view the'world of toniorrow. Soldier Believes In Youth ^ A soldier at Turnet'Pield, Georgia, writes: “i too am a little concerned about what the future holds. At times the shadows are deep and the pictdre gloOmy* Fortunately, there is always a bright light,
dim sometimes, but present.
“The boys in the service do a little thinking too. Pfgsently, when casualty lists mount, they will do a lot naore. JVlThen they read and think, somber thought is put into militant words. The boys don’t like strikes in Wartime—^but they like the progressive things for which the stri|kes strive. They like the end, they don’t like the means. , “Also they don’t like the way things go on in some communities—and Miami Bgach is just a sample. Most of the youth of the world is in the military.service of their country. I have always saidr—and still maintain that the future, of the world will he safe in the hands of youth. Periodically, it seems,,the ardor of youth is curbed by the, anguish of war. But always out of itihas come progress and a better world. I still
havo confidence in youth.
“Congratulations on your fine son.”
Mbiher Blarties Mart On Sfrebt A motherJn Wisconsin who has given one son to the
war expresses a more somber note:

aske4.,tQ.Sujggest good teaphers—if there was ,. an award for poor teacl;ilng, the mail would be ' choked with suggestions. Good teachers are taken for granted; poor teachers inspire the comment. If an instructor does not get along with students, he becomes well-known; well-known as ’ a teacher whose classes should be avoided if . it is at all possible. Instructors who are “good” ' are good because they know the matetrial they teach, teeanse they can and will teach it, and ' because they have cultivated pleasing personalities, too often remain in the background. There are many good teachers on the campus whose classes are not popular because the , subject is not one which arouses general interest. There are others whose classes are not too popular because the student is naturally forced to work harder than in other classes ‘ because of the very nature of the subject in- ^ volVed., There are not-so-good teachers whose classes are extremely popular either because ' the instructor is pseudo-liberal (liberal in that
