Students Greet Mothers Today
Playshop Presents Special Progrpip Fpr Mothers' Week-End Playshop closes its 1940-41 season tonight with the special performance for Mothers’ Day Weekend. Ian Hay’s “Bachelor Bom,” which was presented for the first time on this campus last month, portrays the English school with trials and tribulations of headmasters and tutors. Bill Shprples takes the male leadwhile Virginia Lee Rpddell is in the feminine lead. Other prominent members of the cast are: Pauline Martin; Pat Frigge; Ann Ostrand- ^ er; Harold Martin; and Dick Kohls. While the play ia not a serious dramatic one it doe^ hold an educational problem, treating it lightly and entertainingly. Reserved seat tickets may be obtained by exchanging season coupons or may be purchased for 76 cents. The box office will be open for this during all regular office hpurs and until the curtain goes up at 9 o’clock tonight. Setting for the play, which is one of the most intricate ones ever used on the Playshop stage, was designed and built by Samuel Marks, one of Playshop’s directors. The play is -scheduled for nine to permit visitors to attend both the Sing and “Bachelqr Bom.” m.j.f. Mrs. Cecil Will Talk To Senior Women About Job Seeking Mrs. Harding Cecil, Vice-Presi-dent of tho Brockett-Cecil Shops for town and country clothes, Evanston, Illinois, will talk to the senior women next Monday after- ’ noon. May 12, at four o’clock in the West Faculty Lounge of the Union. “What the Employer Expects in a Prospective Employee” will be the subject of her talk. This should be especially timely for senior women who will graduate in the near fu-
ture.
She will discuss what the jobseeker should wear for ap interview, how she should act, what she should say, and what she shpuld expect. ' Mrs. Cecil was one of the speakers on the Vocational Conference last fall. Before taking her present position at the Brocket-Cecil Shops, she was an assistant buyer at Carson Pirie Scott and Company, Chicago. a.r.w.

'Learn To Think IndependentlyVOr. H. B. Hass
Exppn«xit. By Lee Ruffner “A ^opd teacher should be ^able to teach his students tq think jndependenjjly and intelligently.” 1^his» in tlie opinion of Dy. If. Hass, head of th® University chemistry departmept, is the prime requisite of n good jie^cher. “]For a man to be able to thinfc intelligently and independently he must Ufat fipe hnoflqdga, of course, but tWs ]tnow|eage fs of littfe value to hliU H if i? fully stored afay ip thq Uttfe pfgeon holes of his mind so that he is unable iq brluff t>yo or jnprp of hH ideas together and produce snme- ^ thing that no one else has produced hefore.o “A teacher should constantly try l;o develop this trait in his students hy the use of two points. The first is the dieeeyding of the idea that everything has been done; the second is showing the student that in-
dependent thinking qf iiHention (its direct result) is not necessarily difficult or complicated.” ' 50 iSfew Patents An examination of the record of the chemistry department since Dr. Hass’ arrival 13 years ago would tend to show that he has been rather successful in developing this ability in his students. Thirfeqn years ago there wqre no patents held by any member of the University chemistry staff. Today tpero pre over 5P. ‘4hput 40 of these bear the name of H. B. Hass and nearly all of those 4P name o^ one qt the graduate assistants in the chemistry depaytmenf:. “yhose names are therp ps a result of tjie Original thinking That Qy. Hass considers so i;nporJ#nt, -“^pt ovpryono can he taught to thinjk independently, nafprally, but most people can. It requires effort on the part of the teacher, though. The teacher must have imaginatlop, and always be able to put himself
m the place of the student. “A good teacher should ask himself two questions every five minutes. ‘If I were the student would I understand what I’m saying?’ and, ‘If I were the student would I have any reason for being interested in what I’m saying?”’ interest In Subject Dr. Hass believes* that a ma« should develop into a better teacher as his length of service in the profession increases, but statistics don’t show this to be-i;rue. The reason for this he thinks, is due to the fact that many teachers lose interest in the student’s side of the picture and become so engrossed in their subject that they fail to pee how strange and new it is to the student. ^ , Often, too, the instructor fail? to see that the stpdpnts aren't always inherently interested in his course and fails to give them any good reason for being so. The teacher, thenj musf keep interested ip tl^e subject that he is teaching, but he must alsp
keep the student’s viewpoint in mind. Electives Easier In line with this: “Naturally those teaching electives have a much easier time capturing and keeping the student’s attention than do those who teach the required courses, but with thought, imagination and artistry on the part of the instructor, any cou/se can be made interesting to the average student.” This artistry. Dr. Hass .-says, includes several things besides ordinary interest in and a feeling of the importance of his subject. There are the little mechanics of teaching fhat count for a lot. Listed among these are the habit of getting to class on time, of«^sticking pretty close to the subject and continually afield. “When a professor spends a large portion of his time in pointless discourses off the subject, the reaf, serious student feels that he b^s bpen cheated. And hu has." Dr.'Hass is teaching only ad-
vanced organic chemistry at the present time—except for a numbpr, of lectures to frosh engineers while they consider the organic fields of chemistry. It is in the advanced courses that he really enjoys himself, for while his students have a large number of facts and basic principles to memoidie there is almost unlimited opportunity for original development and thinking to be had. And taught. Sense Of Hnmor There is one thing that is absolutely necessary to any written article about Dr. H. B. Hass. That is the mehtion of his sense of humor. Doc likes a joke, whether he pulled it or whether it was one on him. And, well, we’ve forgotten most of the organic chemistry that he told us about in those |ou): leetpres gave our class throe' years ago^ but we still remember the joke he told. It was the one-about the Spaniard and his donkey, ft seems that a Spaniard rode his mule to town one night and . . .

The Editor Sees It... Because of the nature of what I am about to say I’m going to step out from behind the editorial “we” for the first time in twelve months. The following is therefore purely my own sincere opinion. It can hardly be construed as Exponent policy since the time is almost at hand when I must lay down my editorial pen for good. 1) Like most every other American, I have no "axe to grind, no quarrel with anyone. Instead I have an inherent love for peace. I view with alarm therefore, a statement I heard a responsible member of this community make, expressing that the entire German race be destroyed as a means of establishing permanent peace. 2) I do not feel, as Lindbergh does, that Britain cannot win. But I do feel, as must every one who loves life, that the cost in materials and men should make all of us weigh the price of victory. 3) I cannot overlook the fact that while I have no quarrel with anyone, the converse is not necessarily true. Those who would destroy democracy have built an economic and military wall around my country. I have enemies whether I want them or not. And since America is a very vital part of the world I cannot embrace isolationism. Which brings me to my point. I’m not belligerent toward anybody, I hate bloodshed, but both my peace and security are threatened from without. I’m not convinced that I couldn’t live in a world dominated by a German Europe but neither am I sure that I could worship as I please or speak when I was so inclined. These are now my guarantee under the constitution. I am faced, therefore with a decision. A year ago there were very few things outside of hemispheric defense fhr which I would fight. Today, I am aware of the danger of drawing the line on the things for which I will fight. One cannot stand on principle when surrounded by gangsters. Ideally, the course to pursue is watchful waiting while we give as much material air, as possible, in whatever manner may be necessary, to Britain. This is not a purely selfish motive because it is my own sincere belief that we are not yet prepared to fight in two oceans. But should the President decide that our future is being threatened I’m prepared mentally to suspend my love of peace for love of security.
The University Mourns The Loss Of A Real Friend Edward G. Welch completed his outstanding career of public service Thursday morning. For the past thirty years he had known every student engineer who took Mechanical Engineering Laboratory and could call them all by name. Whenever an engineer returned, one of his first questions was “How’s Eddie?” Only those closely associated with him could appreciate his tireless efforts and his perfect disposition. He started to work at daybreak each day and worked conscientiously all day; but he never was too busy to help anyone in trouble. He often received calls at night and on Sundays and never failed to respond. Eddie has lived a standard of public service which will stand as a monument in the hearts of those who had the benefit of contact with him. Professor David S. Clark, AsB’t Head, ME School.

British Ship Losses Above Vandenberg Total, Expert Says By William H. Sioneman SPECIAL CABLE To The Chicago Daily News Foreign Service. Copyright, 1941. Chicago Daily N^ews, Inc. London, May 9.—Senator Arthur H. Vandenberg’s sensational state-,, ment, tending to show that the Battle of the Atlantic is not much more than a big, rough gamh of tag, apparently was issued wTthbut consulting official and reliable reports that have been printed time and again in the newspapers. (Speaking in the Senate yesterday Michigan’s Republican member cited a letter by Chairman Land of the Maritime Commission, disputing reports that 40 per cent of United States aid to Britain was being sunk on the high seas.) These figures have been printed in these dispatches on several occasions, but may be repeated again. Without taking into consideration sinking figures for April, which are not known to Vandenberg, to Adm. Emory S. Land, or, for that matter, to the British Admiralty itself at the present time, it is possible to get a pretty startling picture of the war at sea by looking only at figures for three months of the year. Total of 240 Ships Sunk According to Lloyd’s register, the Axis sank 240 ships, totaling I, 017,920 tons, in that period. These included 179 British ships of 760,947 tons, 55 Allied ships of 249,724 tons, and six neutrals of 17,249 tons. These contrast with Adm. Land’s figures of 158 British and Allied vessels of 781,919 tons sunk throughout the world in the four months from Jan. 1 to April 30. It is now stated that while losses in the Atlantic during the following month of April were not extremely heavy, losses during the evacuation of Greece ^will make April one of the heaviest months of the war. If this is true, the figures should approach 500,000 tons, giving a total for the first four months of well over 1,500,000 tons. To the British and Allied cause the loss of a ship in the south Atlantic, the Mediterranean or the Indian Ocean is just as serious as the loss of a ship in the Atlantic. It is naturally of extreme importance to keep American planes and tanks coming in a safe and steady stream. For this reason destroyers, corvettes (new type, small-sized warships built by the British especially for convoy duty) and other naval protection have been concentrated on arms ships

For th# information of Vandenberg and anybody else, it may be permissible to mention that, in the opinion of one of the principal neutral shipping experts of this country, the “battle of the Atlantic, or the battle of the seven seas, or whatever you want to call it, and, consequently, the war itself will be won only if the United States enters the war with its navy within one month.” Hort Society . . . will hold a picnic for its last meeting on Wednesday, May 21, at Potters’ Hollow on the east side of town.

Ward Track Meets Set For Next Week The cinder path in the Ross-Ade oVal is to see lots of action next week with two intramural track meets scheduled to be run off on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. Ward track enthusiasts are to have their chance at honors in the oval on Tuesday afternoon while Greek athletes will have their opportunity on the two following
days.
Tuesday’s competition is scheduled to get under way at 4 p. m., with the running of the 100 yard dash. All in all, 12 events are to be run off before the sun sets on the 1941 annual outdoor ward cinder meet. The half mile and mile runs are provided for those lads that shine in the distance events.

First 'Made To Order' Bat Made In Louisville In '84 According to the archives, the first Louisville Slugger was made for Pete Browning in 1884 at a small wood-turning shop in Louisville. Pete was a heqvy hitter for the old Louisville Colonels and wanted a bat made to order for him. He took his problem to J. A. Hillerich, who made the bat and now directs the making of 2,000,000 Louisville Sluggers each year.
widely heralded Piker, Smith, Horvath- and . supporting cast, succumbed last week, 87 to 38. A Week'' earlier the Illini had kept several scorekeepers busy recording a 123-8 triumph over Washington University of St. Louis. Strength in every event accounts
for such huge scores. Star May Not Compete
Don Olsen, the invaders’ speedy hurdler, is still a doubtful entry as a result of a muscle injury sustained at the Drake Relays. He is the Big Ten Indoor Champion in the low hurdles and will probably be withheld from today’s meet so that he will he ready to compete next Friday at Minneapolis. If Olsen is shelved, his place in the low hurdles will be taken by Bill Lewis, a colored boy who specializes in the broad jump and dashes. He is the present Conference king in the broad jump. Dave Rankin, who placed second in the hurdles 'in last year’s Outdoor Championships, -will be on hand to make his path a rough one.
Captains Clash ^
The two teams’ rival captains, Ed Holderman of the Riveters and Park Brown of Illinois, are sched-
Brown was second tb Indiana,’s Campbell Kane in the half mile in this year’s Indoor Conference meet, barely beating. Holderman to the wire. Brown has been a consistent point-getter in both the mile and half mile this spring. Lose But One - Boilermaker Burt Anthony and Bailey of the enemy are expected to provide one of the day’s thrills when they clash in-the 440 yard dash. Incidentally, both Anthony and the mini’s Brown attended New Trier High School iii Winnetka, Illinois. ^ The Riveters’ only defeat thus far outdoors Was ineurred at Columbus last Saturday in a triangu-. lar meet with Ohio State and Indiana. Today’s meet is the first Big Ten dual affair for Coach Hermon Phillips’ pupils. e.c.y. Golf Chipping ... c(jntest will continue today on the practice green at the northwest corner of Intramural Field. Something new on the campus this year, the competition began several days

Meet HMs Today Out of the red and back, into the winning side of the ledger the Boilermaker net squad crushed the tennis team hailing from Illinois Tech yesterday afternoon, 8-0. , Having lost only one encounter thus far this season, the Gold and Black racquet wielders are well- on their way to one of their most successful seasons. Playing ^consistently good tennis despite the cold blasts which persisted in sweeping across the courts, .LaBree’s trainees were able to show ertoUgh power in the pinches to take all of yesterday’s matches. None of the Riveter players succeeded in completely swamping his opponent by defeating him in love sets, blit on the other hand only one set went over the required six-game limit. Stettner, number two man on the Riveter team, and Richards in the number six; spot won their encounters by the largest margins, each turnings in scores of 6-4, 6-2. Only two doubles matches, instead of the usual three, were played yesterday since it Was necessary for the Illinois Tech lads to return to their home grounds earlier than Was expected. . More Today This afternoon will see the playing of the second tennis meet this week-end on Boilermaker home courts. Competition is to be provided for by Iowa in today’s court battles. Starting at 1 p. m. the Iowa matches mark the close of net season as far as home matches are concerned. At least five more matches are on^he schedule but all of them take the Riveter court masters to foreign territory. Thus far LaBree’s men have split even in conference competition, ha,ving taken a match from the Illini team and dropped one to the circuit-leading Michigan team. While Iowa’s team is not considered to be one of the conference leaders it is quite strong, and according to Coach LaBree’s predictions, today’s matches should be hard fought and interesting to watch. d.w.m. Summary Anderson (P) defeated Schultz (I) 6-4, 6-4. Stettner (P) defeated Lange (I) 6-4, 6-2. Armstrong (P) defeated Ferguson (I) 7-5, 6-2. Lucht (P) defeated Sherman (I) 6-4, ’6-4.

. By BOB SWAIM The willowy Don Blanken, junior slabman, barricaded home plate after the first inning of yesterday’s series-opener against Northwestern as his helpers peppered Ross-Ade field with base hits to win their second conference tilt, 6 to 1. Spiritually it was a new team that played for Coach Fehring. Alive in the field and confident at the plate, the Riveters turned their brightest sides toward the Wildcats and outshone their Second-place opponents from the first inning to the finis. * Blanken, bundled up iri two sweat ■' '' - '
-shirts most of the time, turned back the Wildcats with five hits* one of which was a scratch. Six of the Evanston boys were the victims of strikeouts, although none of theni permitted a reoccurance of the batter’s plague. They Hit Boilermaker batters foUnd the delivery of Wildcat Meschuk sailing into their favorite grooves frequently as they slapped eleven hits from the lanky hurler’s pitches. The longest hit of the afternoon was registered in the fifth frame when Don Blanken clubbed a line drive to the left field fence, which is 381 feet from home plate. While Blanken’s arm still had a touch of coldness from the 50-de-gree gale, the Wildcats stepped into his pitches for a run in the first inning. A single by Wendland and a double from the bat of Hennerich tallied the first run of the game.

But after that the Wildcat bats were swinging recklessly, and they hit safely only three times in the following frames, Retalliate However the Riveters overcame the one-run deficit in their half of the first frame when the lead-off man, McFerren, opened with a single and was scored by Janisch’s long triple. Janisch then tallied as Blanken grounded out. Riveter runs_ continued to cross the platter for the next four innings at the rate of one per frame. In the second inning George Doherty sfarted with a single and was batted in from second by McFerren’s second hit. Scoring in the third frame came with Carson’s fielder’s choice and Doherty’s double to right. . More Runs The run in the fourth scored as a result of hits by Fisher, Young and; McFerren. Blanken’s triple in the fifth set the stage for the Riveter’s sixth run. He crossed the plate on an out by Doherty. Harry McFerren had the busiest day at the plate, batting out three singles. Hitting for a total of five bases, John Janisch was the slugger of the day with his double and triple. The famed Bill DeCorrevont went hitless for the^ildcats. Batteries for tomorrow’s game are: Northwestern—Motl and Arnold;'Purdue—Emmert or Leifheit ■ and Young. Time of the game is 2 o’clock.

To Chic«gro Daily News Foreign Service. Oopyright, 1940. Chicago Daily News, Ine • 11 More Nazis Down / “At least 11 more German bombers were shot down last night when the luftwaffe came over again in the moonlight,” cabled William H. Stoneman yesterday from London. This * preliminary figure, he said, brings the total for the first eight nights of May to 85, only five less than for all of April. * IS * • German Sea Raider Sunk A Nazi sea raider has be^en sunk, and 27 British prisoners rescued,, in ':2^he Indian Ocean, London reported yesterday. A Rome communique told of a violent onslaught on a British convoy in the Mediterranean, during which six ships of war were bombed or torpedoed and 16 R. A. F. planes shot down. * * * • /New World Order' -Halifax A new world order built co-oper-atively by the United States and Britain and based on the defeat of the Nazis was pictured in a speech made here yesterday by Lord Halifax, the British ambassador. ■■***,• • 'Planes Shrink Distances “The easiest way to imagine the possible scope of the battle,for the Near East, likely to begin soon, is to think of this area in terms of the airplane,” Richard Mowrer radioed yesterday from Cairo. “Thus distances shrink to their modern proportions.” ,* * * • 'Axis Sinks 1,017,920 Tons' According to Lloyd’s register, cabled William H. Stoneman from London yesterday, in the first three months of this year the Axis • sank 1,017,920 tons of shipping.
