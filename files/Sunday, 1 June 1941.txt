—i—From All Fronts— Today's Summary Of War News
To Chicago Daily Newp Foreign Service. C!<4>yrigbt, 1»40. Chicago Paily News, Ine, • Arabs Ask For Armistice Fighting in Iraq—if any—^has resolved itself into a war between the British and the Germans, radios William H. Stoneman from London. In the estimation of the British the struggle for Iraq can in no way be considered a fight between the Empire and the Arabs since an Arab committee of four now in control has asked the British for an armistice. I|! !|S ^ • Say Bismarck 50,000 Tons If, as British naval officers who took part in her sinking, now declare, the German battleship Bismarck was a 50,000 ton ship, naval building programs all over the world, and particularly in the United States and Great Britain, will be subject to speedy and comprehensive revision, London observers say. * iH * • Chinese Suppress Civil War A. T. Steele, now in Chungking, ..says that pressure of American opinion is doing much to forestall a/complete breakdown in China’s ^united front. The American reaction to the New 4th Army incident has awakened Chinese leaders to the fact that the United States would frown on civil war in China. * H- • Franco Putty To Hiller Hitler rfow has such a grip on the supine General Franco that Germany can move through Spain to the Portuguese ports on the Atlantic and to Spanish and African coasts on the Mediterranean around Gibralter at any time he chooses to make a bold effort to hamstring Britain, observers now believe. * * * • British Coordinate Publicity The British are about to make important changes, in their information service in the United States as a result of acute dissatisfaction with present arrangements. DebrisCallout . . . for freshmen interested in working on the business staff next year will be held in room 263 of the Union at 4 p. m. tomorrow. Anyone answering this callout will be per-^ mitted to register ear\y next year in order to sell Debris at registrati6n.
Exponent Continues Publication With 17 Summer Session Issues
By J. H. Wendel West Lafayette’s heat can’t stop the University, even in July and August, and what’s more, it can’t stop the Exponent. Starting right in on June 12, the summer Exponent will appear twice a week, on Tuesday and Friday mornings, through the rest of June and July. In August it will appear on Fridays until the 16th. It will be the same sjze as the regular paper. All students who are sweltering through summer school will receive the paper without cost to them. Those of you who won’t be here during vacation may have the 17 summer issues mailed to your home address for just 60 cents. Important Announcements Having the summer session Exponent to read when you’re enjoying your vacation isn’t such a bad idea — there’s always something happening on the campus in which you’ll be interested. Many important announcements from the University that may affect you next semester appear during the summer; forewarned, they say.
Then too, there is summer prom. The band may be your favorite, and co-eds may again have two o’clock hours as they did last year; so you may want to come “back to old Purdue” for a night. Convocations continue throughout the summer, too, and the Music Hall is air conditioned. Easy To Order - If you are going to be here yourself, your parents may want to know what’s going on here. Fifty cents will send it home to them, and you won’t have to think about it again. Orders for mailed subscriptions will be taken at the West Desk, the Exponent office, and by many salesmen who will be around the campus during the next few days., Traugott In Charge In charge of the summer Expon-, ent will be John Traugott, news editor. Don Brophy, Bob Hadley, and John Amos, here for chem and met summer school, will be associate editors and take charge of the individual papers.
By A. T. Steele , SPECIAL RADIO To Chicago Daily News Foreign Service. Copyright, 1941. Chicago Daily News, Inc. Shanghai, May 31. — Japan has replied sharply to American appeasement rumors with a reaffirmation of her Axis alignment and renewed pressure on the Dutch East
Indies.
In line with her consistently opportunistic pouicy, Japan today is turning the heat full on the Indies at a time when the Axis is scoring new conquests in the Mediterranean and America is soft-pedaling Asiatic issues. It was announced today that the Japanese hope to force a decision within 10 days in their economic negotiations with the Dutch at Batavia, capital of Java. Kenkichi Yoshizawa, 67-year-old chief of the Japanese mission in the Indies, indicated in a telephone interview to Tokyo newspapers that he expected a Dutch answer some time in the next week to Japan’s “final proposals.” What these demands are is not specified but the Japanese admit that one of their urgent requirements is larger allotments of Dutch oil. The Japanese press has burst into a chorus of anger and impatience over Dutch “arrogance and procrastination” and professes to see evidences of an Anglo-Ameri-can-Dutch conspiracy aimed at
Japan.
Statement of Intimidation Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka has chimed in with a statement which savors strongly of intimidation. Matsuoka said last night: “As has been frequently affirmed, Japan’s policy toward the South Seas is peaceful. Shoul(|, however, any untoward international developments render the execution of such a policy impossible, Japan may have to reconsider her attitude in the light of the changed situa-
tion.”
Dutch Attitude Stiffens According to reliable reports from Batavia, thg Dutch attitude has stiffened since the visit there of Eelco E. Van Kleffens, foreign minister of the refugee Dutch gov-
ernment.
The Dutch apparently are still confident that the Japanese will be reluctant to carry out their thinly

Firemen From Entire State To Attend Annual Fire ScKoolJune 3-6
Between 600 and 800 firemen from almost every city and village in the state are expected to attend the eighth annual Indiana Fire School which will be held at the University June 3 to 6. The school will cover three general fields in which firemen play important roles: fire fighting, inspection for fire prevention, and the inspection of vital defense industries vulnerable to sabotage through arson. Men prominent in these various fields will take part in the program, speaking or giving demonstrations covering their specialties. There will be a special session on rural electrification inspection, made necessary by the rapid expansion of rural electrification lines in the state under the REA and private
utilities.
Demonstrations Planned |
Among the more interesting features will be demonstrations on extinguishing incendiary bombs, oil fires, and inflammable liquid fires; use of gas masks; hose and ladder evolutions; portable equipment for fighting rural fires; and the Army’s most modern methods and aid in fighting and preventing fires. Coupled with these features will be discussions of the handling of arson cases, school building inspection, organization of industrial plant protection problems, and every-day problems confronting the
fire departments of our state.
The School is under the supervision of the Engineering Extension department co-operating with the Indiana Fire Marshal’s Department, the state inspection bureau and the various firemen’s organ-
izations in the state, a.p.h.

U S War Department Announces Changes In Exam For Flyers Changes in the written examination for appointment as a flying cadet for those who have not h.ad two years at an accepted college or university have been announced by the War Department. The new requirements will give candidates wider latitude in satisfying the standards. The examination that prospective flying cadets were formerly required to pass, covering nine subjects in lieu of two years’ work at a recognized college or university, will now cover seven subjects. Five of these are required subjects and the applicant is allowed to choose two others from a list of five. Required Subjects Required subjects are as follows: English composition and grammar, arithmetic, algebra, plane goemtry, and plane trigonometry. The student may choose any two of the following subjects to complete his list of seven subjects: United States history, general history, elementary physics, inorganic chemistry, and any modern language except English. The educational examinations are given four times a year by boards at 54 stations and cities in the. United States and possesions.
Notice
Candidates for bachelor’s degrees, who fail to complete the requirements for graduation in June, may, if they desire, attend the Commencement Exercises. They march in the procession in a special group with the candidates of August, 1941 (not with their own class). C. r" and gowns are required. Such persons must give notice of their intentions at the Registrar’s office on or before Saturday, June 7. They may receive two tickets for the use of their friends, if they have not already received tickets upon payment of the diploma fee. Ralph B. Stone, Registrar.
degrees next Sunday there are 24 of last January’s graduates who will be here to get diplomas with the class of 1941 while 84 others who finished in January and others who completed their work in August, 1940, will be included in the roll of 1941 graduates, making a total of about 1290. No Commencement Address In accordance with the policy established several years ago, there will be no commencement address. President Elliott will read a short statement which he has prepared, and which is included in the diploma. The old style tubular sheepskin was abandoned by the University some time ago and 1941 diplomas will resemble a thin, two page book. One page will be the actual certificate and the other the final message from the President., The head of each school will present the graduates from his par~ticular school to President Elliott, who will personally hand the diplomas to each student. Candidates for bachelors degrees (Continued on page 4) Prof. Louis D. Rowell T 0 Retire, Ending 30 Years In University Professor Louis D.

Grab A Halo And Deplore
The United States is probably the deploringest nation in the world. How many times in our history have our statesmen “viewed with alarm” for reasons of political expediency and to relieve the consciences of their constituents ? We have morally deplored the persecution of synthetic minorities in Europe, and steadily refused to allow these peoples to enter our country. We have been putting on a most vindictive show of animosity toward Japan for over a decade. The practicality of which we Americans so often boasFpermits us, however, to do an excellent job of equipping the Japanese war machine. We made ourselves feel most righteous by deploring Prussian militarisni; and then we “forgot” to help the Weimar Republic when it was dying despite the desperate efforts of the German democrats. We thought the League of Nations was fine, but not for us. And how we deplored the miserable League when it failed to stop the beginnings of World War II in Ethiopia! And in spite of the fact that any ass today should be able to understand brute force and all its accompanying ugliness, it is disheartening to find that we still have so many professional deplorers. Our population views the Nazi idea with alarm and figuratively raises its chubby little arms and says, “Tut, tut, how utterly deplorable.” This while the world’s remaining defender of our political and economic system is trying bitterly to keep itself in one piece. We refuse to believe that “no man is an island, entire in itself; every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main.” If many now understand the lie of isolationism, too many still believe it. “Short-of-war!” No more stupid phrase was ever devised. Of course President Roosevelt and people of reasonable intelligence know this.
“Short-of-war” is for the ears of a nation that has no faith and is not willing to make a last stand for humanist ideals. We whine abo^t aiding England as long as that aid doesn’t endang'er us. The Irish have their nationalistic hatred of the English. The liberals have their girlish pacifism, their dislike of British imperialism. Norman Thomas, who seems to have forgotten the fate of the German and Austrian socialists who fought too late, would like England to win but is afraid to help her. The Midwest isolates itself in its cornstalks and doesn’t like “to be messed up in what New England is doing.” California wants England to win, of course, but is more interested in taking care of Japan. New York doesn’t give a damn about Japan—except to sell her scrap iron. Why, in God’s name, do we aid England if we are afraid of the consequences ? It would be cheaper and a whole lot more intelligent to help Germany and end this war in a few months. Is there any point in frantically spending billions to build a two-ocean navy which will only serve to mock us when the last British ship has been torpedoed ? Our shipbuilding facilities will be, laughable along side the Axis’ when the British fleet is destroyed. Before the war Germany imported only 20 per cent of her foodstuffs; almost 70 per cent of England’s came from overseas. Germany imported only half her oil; England 100 per cent. Clearly the English merchant marine which is rapidly going to the bottom is Britain’s only method of staying in the war. And still oilr Congress refuses the use of idle American ships, or our warships for convoy. Some day after U-boats have depleted the English merchant marine enough to make it useless, we will, of course, send our own. So it goes. After we have taken all of England’s money and so permanently' upset the world economic balance, we shall repeal the Johnson act. Then, after Britain has been defeated and we have had our Munich, we shall make a last stand in South America when the cause is already lost and our military position is impossible. Can anyone help becoming a defeatist while watching this tragic comedy? And still we shall continue to hope, j.l.t.
Column/faZ/Right
Down in Washington FDR must be having troubles aplenty. Economists tell him Thanksgiving must be changed again. Congress wants a vacation. With pay. And Roosevelt himself pulls a boner. With (censored) to pay. First he opened the bedroom window an inch too wide. Woke up with a sore throat. Called in the White House physician. Stuck out his tongue. And said ... “Ahhhh . . .,, “Officially I feel sick this morning.”
The illness was for the best anyway. He fooled sev-^ eral million members of the Fii’eside Chat Club. Very neatlyi Into believing that his sore throat explained why he didn’t feel a shot coming on. The way we have it figured out, Rudolf Hess unthinkingly dropped in on Scotland for a drink of water. And thereby. Stole Roosevelt’s headlines. * * *
Also disrupted all American’s plans for a quiet evening at home. And proved about German parachutes what we’ve been saying about American coffee for generations. Good to the last drop. * * >i< j As for the hospitality which Hess received — tea costs the host more than does water. We can’t imagine a true Scotsman behaving like that. The ordinary American would have laid Hess low with a blow of the hand. Dragged his victim home for the night. And started out early the next morning. On a lecture tour to make money.

veiled threats of invasion until they are ready to risk war with Great Britain and the United States. The urgency of the Japanese demand's doubtlessly has- been increased by the closing of the door to Philippine sources of supply and to agitation in America for a complete oil embargo on Japan. Japs Resent Weiss Bill The Weiss bill at present before Congress in Washington is deeply resented by Japan. Japan continues to give full publicity to appeasement gossip in the United States, with especial emphasis on its possible discouraging effect on Chungking (capital of Gen. Chiang Kaishek’s government). Hitherto, there has been little tendency to reciprocate, though the Japan Newsweek, American-edited Tokyo weekly, today voiced the opinion that ‘the American situation seems favorable to an effort toward some sort of general compromise.” It is hard, however, to find much spirit of compromise in the blunt statement issued yesterday by MatBuoka. Refuting rumors that Japan is becoming indifferent to the tripartite pact (with Berlin pnd Rome), Matsuoka brought some comfort to his worried German allies by reiterating that the pact remains a pivot of Japanese policy and that “it is absolutely impossible to imagine that Japan should fail in the slightest degree to carry out faithfully her obligations under the accord.”

Fifteen Intramural Baseball Players Make All-Star Team By placing two men apiece on the All-Star baseball team, the Delta Tau Delta and Theta Chi fraternities and Ward 25 virtually dominated this year’s select group. The Delts, winners of this year’s intramural baseball championship, placed three men on a similar squad last year. In all, nine fraternity men and six unorganized meh gained positions on the fifteen man squad. The selection of this choice squad '
was made possible by the vote of the sports managers from each fraternity house, ward and section of Cary Hall. All votes were compiled by the all-star committee composed of two fraternity men, two intra-mural men and one each -from Cary Hall and the Wards. Ace footballer Pete Timperman served as chairman of the committee. Three Court Stars Named Listed among the first fifteen were three fellows whose talents have been brought before the public eye before because of their basketball ability. Charlie Caress, Sigma Chi, and John Tierney, Phi Gamma Delta, were chosen by their opponents as two of the five best pitchers in the league. Both lads have played a lot of basketball for Piggy Lambert

By virtue of their two victories over Northwestern Thursday and Friday, the Michigan baseball squad won the Big Ten championship with a season record of ten wins and two defeats. This splendid record put them considerably ahead of Iowa, their nearest rival for the title. The Hawkeye nine finished with a record of six wins to three losses. Slugger Wakefield Leading the attack on the Wildcats was Dick Wakefield, the Michigan slugger who is well remembered to Riveter fans because of his two lusty home runs against the Boilermaker squad last week. The big sophomore lad from Chicago, 111., slammed out two homers in the first game with Northwestern. On the following day against the same team, he managed to get two singles in five trips to the plate, driving in two runs. During the series several major league scouts including Joe Gallagher from the Chicago Cugs were keeping a constant eye on Wakefield, j.s.d. Intramural Golf ... in both “A” and “B” flights will officially end today as the final rounds are played off. Bill Salzman will play Larden Hoffman in their final match in the “A” league and Tom Graham is to engage Bob Kuntz in the “B” flight flnals.
There will be two main classes of representatives at the events; those hailing from universities like Michigan or Purdue, and those from colleges such as Iowa State or Earlham. Four Riveters To Run The Boilermaker contingent at the Meet will consist of Captain Ed Holderman, the only senior to make the trip, who will run the mile. Cap-tain-elect Burt Anthony who will compete in the 440, Bill Bancker, 220 dashman and Bill Gaulke who is to handle the 100 yard dash. In addition to their individual contests, these four trackmen will team together to run in the one-half mile relay race. Almost all of the stars of this past cinder season will be at the Central Collegiates competing for their respective schools. The now famous Campbell Kane-Roy Cochran-Archie Harris j;rio from Indiana will be there and so will Ohio State’s hurdler Bob Wright and another Buckeye star, Eisenhart. Ray And Rendleman Again Ray and Rendleman, two Chicago lads who last week did most of the scoring for the Maroons when they were defeated here by the Boilermakers will also be competing in the broad jump, high jump and shot put. Another school from up around the Windy City, Northwestern, will be well represented by two top hurdlers, Horvath and Pinch, sprinter Myron Piker, and Thistlewaite, a lad who does all right in the polfe vault. In general the Riveter squad has had a highly successful outdoor season thus far with no losses chalked up against them in dual meet competition. Michigan State, Butler, Illinois and Chicago all bowed to the prowess of the Riveters who suffered no great disappointment on the cindered oval until the Big Ten catastrophe up at Minneapolis. There, to great disappointment of all Boilermakers concerned the squad failed to place any men on the Conference team which will make the trip to the coast for the Pacific Coast Meet on June 17. j.s.k.

British Hampered By Lack Of Support in Skies Over Crete By Richard Mowrer SPECIAL CABLE To Chicago Daily News Foreign Service. Copyright, 1941. Chicago Daily News, Inc. Cairo, May 31. — From the battle of Crete, one fact is evident: The side without air control, or even air parity, is handicapped. The British, in Crete, had slight air support during the first days of the German attack because Royal Air Force planes had been withdrawn from the island’s three airdromes. They were withdrawn because the British knew that the German invasion was coming and knew that this would involve terrific and continuous bombings of airdromes. If the R. A. F. planes had stayed in Crete they would have been destroyed on the ground, or else, if they had managed to take to the air when the German attack began, they either would have had to land again on the bombed and strafed airdromes of Crete and crash into bomb craters, or use all their fuel to try to reach British airdromes in North Africa. Germans Win Mastery So, duiing the first days of the Germ^ air invasion, the British were without air support. The Germans had absolute mastery over the island. They overcame the defenders’ advantage of being entrenched, prepared and more heavily armed to meet parachutists’ attack, by using bombers as air artillery. Geiman pressure on the defenders increased. The Britons had some artillery, but could not compete with incessant air bombings. The Germans had air control. They were able to operate from near-by bases in the Dodecanese and in Greece. They made the most of their advantage. Navy Needs Air Support Crete being an island, the British Navy went out to intercept attempted enemy landings by sea that would have enabled the Germans quickly to get tanks, guns and many more troops to the support of the air-borne troops already on the island. Enemy transports were attacked, sunk and dispersed. This was at night. With daylight, planes appeared and battle between warships and airplanes began. Here again the advantage of complete air control was demonstrated. The British admit the loss of two cruisers, the Gloucester and the Fiji; four destroyers, the Juno, Greyhound, Kelly and Kashmir, and the loss of the ciuiser Yoik, previously disabled in Suda Bay. The navy appealed to the R. A. F. for air support. In a small sea like the Mediteriapean ships are extremely vulneiable to air attack unless adequately supported in the air. However, air support means air control in the zone where warships are operating. • Thanks to proximity of the Dodecanese, Aegean Islands and Greece, the Germans were well placed to extend their air control over the sea surrounding Crete. The R. A. F., on the other hand.
Wa/t Leifheit Takes Elliott To Present Wolverines Triumph^

According to the final averages for the 1941 baseball season, Walt Leifheit and Harry McFerren wei’e the two outstanding hitters on this year’s squad with .380 and .370 records respectively. These averages include all the 26 games played by the Riveter squad. In addition to leading in the singing department, sophomore Walt Leifheit tied with the veteran hurler Johnny Emmert for the best percentage of games won and lost. Each won 6 and lost 2. The three above mentioned pastimers have been leading their respective departments since the southern trip during the latter part of March. At that time McFerren and Leifheit were sporting .600 batting averages, while Leifheit and Emmert had each won two games. By far the most improved players on the squad were catcher Ernie Young and outfielder-third baseman George Doherty. At the beginning of the season both boys were riding the bench. Before many games had gone by, however, Doherty was stationed in left field and then shifted to third base where he became a permanent fixture. George finished the season with an average of .299, fourth best among the Riveter batteis.

had its closest landing fields in Malta, 600 miles away, and in the Western Desert of Egypt, 300 miles away. R. A. F. bombers carried out night raids on German airdromes, including the one they had captured at Malemi. In the daytime they could not operate without fighter protection. And the range of a Hurricane is insufficient to go to Crete and fight, even for just 10 minutes, and return to its base. Yet the R. A. F. has done just that. It sacrificed some of its planes’ armor m favor of subsidiary fuel tanks and flew off to Crete despite the impaired fighting capacity of its machines.
