Indiana Music Campaign Model For Movements In Other States
It was learned this week at the Lafayette Music Appreciation headquarters that Edward T. Ingle, national director of the Music Appreciation Committee, has announced the future plans for campaigns in other states will be modeled on the v/ork done in Indiana. William H. Ball of Muncie, chairman of the Indiana division of the National Committee, sponsor for the Indiana movement, made the announcement. Ji. Ingle is a frequent visitor to Indiana, and is a former member of the editorial staff of the Indianapolis Star. Recently he has been with the National Broadcasting Company in New York where he aided in the development of the Damrpsch Music Appreciation program. He spent several weeks in Indiana recently promoting the music appreciation campaigns and made speeches over the state before educational groups and assemblies of civic and cultural leaders. The setup in Indiana being used as a model for other states is a distinct tribute to the work of the Indiana committee, of which President Rdward C. Elliott is a member. Perhaps much of the honor should go to Mrs. H. H. Amholter of Indianapolis, member of the board of the Indianapolis Sym-
phony Orchestra, who has served as state organizer for the campaigns, making plans in each city for the promotion of fine music through the sale of the symphonies. She has visited Lafayette and the University campus several times in the course of the last two months, working with Albert P. Stewart and Dr. F. D. Martin, co-chairmen of the local campaign, and with Miss Helen L. Walters, who is in charge of the local headquarters. Fourteen cities in Indiana now are distributing the symphonies, sponsored in many cases by newspapers. Stewart, University choral director, said yesterday when told of this honor for Indiana, “It is very gratifying to learn of this honor to Indiana’s Music Appreciation movement. No doubt the people in this vicinity will be pleased to learn that the sale in Lafayette, as in other communities, is not only bringing fine music to the masses at a low cost, but is also benefitting Indiana music in general. The Lafayette unit of the Indiana Symphony Society is receiving 3 cents for each symphony sold locally, and the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra is receiving 10 cents from each sale in Indiana for its maintenance fund.”
Last night Scabbard and Blade, national military honorary, held formal initiation in the armory for 28 cadet officers, three band members and one honorary member. The honorary member was Dr. Sayers John Miller, university health director. A banquet was held in the faculty lounge of the Union following the initiation. Toastmaster for the banquet was cadet officer George Olson, who introduced the speaker of the evening, Elmer Waters, prominent alumnus and honorary member of Scabbard and Blade. Colonel Berre, PMS and T at the University made a few remarks. The response for the pledge class was made by L. B. McCam-
mon.
Cadet officers initiated were F. J. Roth, J, W. Post, B. Golding, Y- A. Woodling, J. R. Blackwell, W. F. Taylor, J. J. Vana, S. H. Wheeler, L. D. Gilmore, A. C. Weed, L. B. McCammon, H. Wist, M. E. Keane, H. C. Goebel, C. L. Norquest, and A. W. Kettler. Also A. C. George, J. W. Oswalt, R. T. Machery, R. G. Massey, K. J. Thompson, R. E. Hawker, G. T. Sollitt, L. E. Aull, B, W. Gibson, W. A. Ward, S. E. Wemgren, J. R. Jacobsen. Band members initiated were H. A. Todd, H. Smith, and R. A. Krull. Riding Club To Stage Gymkhana May 12; Features Novelties According to Dave S. Hartman, president of the University riding club, plans for the club’s 1940 gymkhana and horse show, to be staged Sunday afternoon. May 12, as a feature of the Mother’s Day week-end program, are nearly completed. An outstanding number of three-gaited and five-gaited privately owned horses from all parts of the state are expected in the open classes. In addition to the open classes for privately owned horses, there will be horsemanship classes for boths eds and co-eds from all colleges and universities of the state, and a junior horsemanship class for girls and boys 15 years old or less. Parade Planned Among the many events of the afternoon will be an opening parade of all contestants and a novice jumping contest open only to amateurs with the horses to be shown over eight jumps not exceeding three feet in height. Some of the novelty events will be , a special “fancy-get-up” class, a “musical chair” scramble, a trotting race under saddle, and a series of exhibition jumps. Arrangements are being made by the officers of the riding club to provide ample seating accommodations for around three thousand specta-
tors.

Three On Business; Adopt New Policy
JOHN McELROY, Editor-in-Chief
Courtney Will Play For Cary Hall Dance Tomorrow In Union Cary Hall “Joes” will swing out with their “Josephines” tomorrow night from 9 to 12 p.m. to the tunes of Del Courtney and his Candid Camera swingsters, who will provide music styled by Orville Knapp for the Cary Hall informal “Joe” dance to be held in the Union. The most informal of atmospheres will pervade both the north and southballrooms as those present at the dance relax and let themselves go. The three Dells, Joe Martin, Sherman Hayes, and Dick Didline will be starred as vocalists. Decorations will add to the informality, and will consist of Prom decorations plus more color and will feature a picture of a “Joe” boy and girl together with a Cary Hall crest on the backdrop. The bandstands will display “Joe” sayings and will no doubt give forth some jitterbug exclamations. Tickets will be wood grain facsimile and the programs will be two brass “P’s” hinged together with dance information sandwiched in between. Courtney, who plays the trumpet and piano, will also sing and do impersonations. He has played in practically every state in the union since his student days at the University of California, where he had a campus band. He has made recordings for Brunswick and Vocalion. Members of the dance committee are Joe Price, chairman, Alan Batsford, Dick Zweig, George Kintner, Carl Lutz, Bob Mullet, Jack Daley, Norm Smith, George Frey, Wally Schalck, and Walter Swigart.

Hall Of Music Designers Instill Beauty, Promote Acoustics
By Bill Heaton Primary aim of Hall of Music designers was, of course, acoustical perfection. Forthcoming tests will soon determine the degree of perfection attained. Perhaps, and all concerned with its development are hoping for the best, it will be the most advanced structure of its type in the country. Probably the most noticeable result of the painstaking designers’ efforts is the ‘zig-zag’ construction of the sidewalls. Alternate ‘zigs’ or ‘zags’, have it your own way, are covered with a sponge-like sound absorbing material in a pastel blue shade. Remaining ones have painted surfaces in the same color, and have lights concealed in them at a height of about 12 feet. Predominating colors are ashes of rose and pastel blue. Light cream is used for trim. As one faces the stage he is impressed with the colorful beauty of the rose tinted areas framing the immense opening. And we do mean immense! The front cornices are a combination of blue and rose. Four long, continuous rows of direct lights, enclosed in strips of translucent glass, traverse the length of the ceiling. Areas between these rows of lights are covered with a sound absorbing material in cream. Continuing the motiff of rose and blue are the luxurious seats. Not only are these seats, with their blue leather bottoms and matching blue mohair backs, the most comfortable we have on the campus, they are part of the acoustical equipment of the building. Seat backs contain sound absorbing materials capable of absorbing as much soimd when empty as the average person would while occupying the seat. Thus, audience and
performer are assured of consistent reception, regardless of the size of the audience. Watch your step when you set down in these seats. A concealed spring keeps them in an upright position, and it gives one a strange feeling to find that the seat has popped up before he could sit down. It is interesting to note that the total number of seats was cut down 107 when it was decided to increase the distance between the rows one inch. It’s a great relief to find that you don’t have to stand up to let somebody into your aisle. Of the 6,146 seats, representing the larg^t seating capacity in the country, 3,626 are on the main floor, 1,622 in the lower balcony, and 898 in the upper balcony. Balcony construction is indeed worthy of mention. Support for both balconies is entirely cantilever with no columns to obstruct the vision. Balcony frame members are anchored to the outside wall of the building, while columns built into the interior wall furnish a pivot for the transfer and alteration of the downward force exerted by the filling of the balconies. Beauty spot of the entire building, if, indeed, one can be singled out, is the main foyer or lobby. The Mi-y bridge’ from the Executive building opens into this beautiful room, tha floor of which is on a level with the main floor of the aforementioned Executive building. Dry bridge sidewalls, composed mostly of structm’al glass blocks, make the bridge interior very attractive. Heavy carpeting, walnut and marble siding, and indirect lights pla3nng on a light cream ceiling, plus an area 30 by 150 feet, impart (Continued from page 8)P0BDOE EXPONENT

Football “Although the squad will be green at the beginning of next year’s season, as proven by spring practices, the traditional I’urdue pep and enthusiasm combined ■with the added incentive necessitated by the closeness of competition for every position should make up for this lack of experience and provide a well balanced team for the season next year,” remarked Coach IV^al Elward at practice in Ross-Ade Stadium yesterday afternoon Frosh Improving The outstanding point of the past few week’s spring practices has been the improvement of freshmen canaidates for the various positions. Seveial of the frosh are giving the leturning veterans all of the competition that they care to bare. According to Elward, the following 29 first year men have been showing up well in practice, and are strong possibilities for varsity berths next season Ends: iting, Shimer, McCafrey, Hartup, Mast, and Lowe, Tackles' Powers, Warlen, O’Brien, Fryback, and Hill, Guards Hillenbrand, Voecs, Applebaum, and Henderson, Centers Van Aiken, Lugo, and Gmerra, Left halfback Carter, Brock, and Cook, Quarteiback Carey, Snyder, and Smerke; Fullbacks BulRngton and Fijala, Right halfback Anderson, Beito, and Blair Efiiciency Via Airways Coach Elward was very optimistic over the improvement of the squad’s passing attack over last year Brock, Carter, Fijali, Berto, and Byelene have the sharpest eyes at tossing the pigskin, with McCafley. King, and Shimer outstanding on the receiving end Another bright note in the spring practice is the way in which the fullback spot IS being taken caie of, with veterans Petty and Shumachei providing the outstanding punch. Gala Week Game In an attempt to provide experience for the squad, a large part of the off-season practices have been relegated to scrimmage sessions Spring practice will draw to a close May 4 with a final inter-squad tussle between the Golds and the Blacks before a Gala-Week crowd

Campus leaders spoke at the third and last forum sponsored by PIA last night in the East Faculty Lounge of the Union. The general topic of discussion was, “What Should I Expect on a Date?” Subtopics discussed were the problems of corsages, transportation, the correct manner of asking for a date, and whether to double date or not. It was agreed that corsages were not required in a great many cases; and that double dating should be practiced whenever it is possible to
arrange it.
This was the third in a series of forums on etiquette begun by a discussion on “Pardon Me,” the book writtenby Georgann Schilling, Coed Editor of the Exponent, and published by PIA.

AN OPEN LETTER TO THE SENIOR CLASS
There’s a student that comes into our office on an average of 100 times a week. This is because the hat and the student are inseparable. Yesterday we asked him what we could do to induce him to leave the filthy thing on a peg outside. He said that he was an engineer at heart, and as such was always efficient in everything he did . . . even to the handling of his hat from morning to night. We asked him if he wore it into see Jack Walters when he went to talk about job prospects for himself. He said that he Avas a junior and had not, as yet, consulted Mr. Walters about anything specific. We asked him if he would wear his hat into Mr. Walters’ office when the time came. He said he didn’t think it was good manners or good sense. We asked him if he wears his hat into the adjacent office of D^an Potter. He said he did consistently. We asked him if he thought this was any less discourteous than wearing his hat into the office across the hall. He said no, but Dean Potter wasn’t getting him a job. We asked him if he didn’t think that he was giving Purdue a black eye by being seen with his hat on inside the University’s various offices and buildings. We asked him if he didn’t think it was hurting himself as much as the other 6,999 students by running down Purdue’s reputation for courtesy. He said he guessed we were right. He came in to see us again today .. . carrying the old lid. Now he’s even contemplating combing his hair now and then. It’s just as efficient that way, and fewer visitors to the Boilermaker campus will be offended. —R. E. I.
Now that Pi’om is over and Gala Week, final exams, and commencement are in the offing, seniors must look forward to ending college careers And commencing greater life careers. Much like the cap and gown, commencement invitations are an important part of the preparations for graduating the Class of 1940. Sad to say, seniors are not “com-mencement-minded.” It is hard to make them realize that although graduation takes place June 9, the Gala Week Committee must distribute invitations and announcements beginning May 10 or May 12. This means that our order must be given to the manufacturer by April 29. Our advance order list must close Friday evening, April 26, but majr be reopened Monday, April 29, for one day only. Invitations and announcements are of more attractive design than ever before, while the prices remain the same as those of the last several years. Deac’s, Southworth’s, and the Union west desk have samples of invitations and announcements for you to see before order- ■ ing. The motto of the Gala Week committee has been, “An Unforgettable Gala Week.” May we extend this to include an “unforgettable commencement” hoping that your invitations and announcements will help you and your friends and relatives to remember the occasion? Sincerely, The 1940 Gala Week Committee.
But
Incidentally—
By Serge While showing the gal friend a!round the Union last week-end, we ambled thru the tunnel that comes out in the bowling alleys. No, we weren’t looking for that couch that is supposed to be in one of those darkrooms. Or were we? Anyway, we explained, “These are the Union dark-rooms. They’re always kept locked.” And to prove the point we tried a knob as we breezed by. Surprisingly enough, the door opened, and as we looked back a Chinaman, looking unreasonably like Mr. Motto, poked his head out. We knew they dug those dark-rooms too deep.
